## Overview

Police Quest II: The Vengeance is an adventure game developed and published by Sierra On-Line in November 1988, serving as the direct sequel to Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel.[^ref-1] Designed by [[Jim Walls]], a former California Highway Patrol officer, the game continues the story of Detective Sonny Bonds as he pursues the escaped drug lord Jesse Bains, known as the "Death Angel."[^ref-2] The game was the third title to use Sierra's new SCI engine, following King's Quest IV and Leisure Suit Larry II, representing a significant technical advancement over its AGI-based predecessor.[^ref-3]

The game is widely regarded as "a crown jewel of its era" and "the best game of its series," setting what Adventure Gamers called "pre-Gabriel Knight, the standard for the serious adventure game."[^ref-3] Unlike typical fantasy adventures of the era, Police Quest II focused on realistic police procedures, requiring players to follow proper protocol to effectively complete the game and achieve the highest score.[^ref-4] This attention to detail in police work—from filling out reports to performing thorough investigations—set the game apart from other adventure titles of its time.[^ref-5]

The game's scenarios were based on situations that Jim Walls actually experienced during his career with the California Highway Patrol, adding an authentic layer of realism and danger.[^ref-2] Notably, the antagonist Jesse Bains was based on a real escaped convict who was still at large when the game was released, a fact that Jim Walls addressed publicly: "These kinds of people are actually running around out there, even if we don't want to think about it."[^ref-1]

## Story Summary

Little time has passed since the events of Police Quest, when Sonny Bonds climbed the ranks of the Lytton Police Department and became the key element in the arrest of Jesse Bains, the notorious drug lord.[^ref-6] Now promoted to the homicide department, Bonds' life has improved considerably—he's even begun dating Marie Wilkans, the woman he protected during the first game. However, the tranquility is shattered when Bains escapes from prison, setting in motion a deadly game of revenge.[^ref-7]

Bains's vendetta against Sonny becomes intensely personal when he abducts Marie Wilkans, Sonny's girlfriend.[^ref-8] The threat is made explicit through a chilling note discovered in a car trunk: "You're a DEAD man, Sonny Bonds!"[^ref-9] What follows is a tense investigation that takes Bonds across the fictional city of Lytton and beyond, as he works to track down Bains before it's too late.

While the first game was largely based on street police work, this sequel shifts focus to forensics field work, emphasizing the collection of evidence that links Bains to the crimes occurring throughout the game.[^ref-10] The investigation leads Bonds through multiple crime scenes, including Cotton Cove where a brutal murder has occurred. The trail eventually takes him beyond city limits, involving airplane travel and culminating in a harrowing underwater confrontation.

The game builds to a nerve-wracking finale that players have praised as "one of the most nerveracking endings to an adventure game."[^ref-11] Bonds must rescue Marie while simultaneously confronting Bains in a deadly showdown that requires both careful procedure and quick thinking. The story maintains the series' commitment to realism while delivering a personal revenge narrative that raises the stakes considerably from the first installment.[^ref-12]

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Police Quest II utilizes Sierra's text parser interface, where commands are given in verb/noun combinations such as "Unlock Door" or "Take Keys," though some keyboard shortcuts are available for common actions.[^ref-4] The game supports mouse navigation, an improvement over the purely keyboard-driven original.[^ref-13] Players type commands to interact with the environment, examine objects, and communicate with other characters throughout the investigation.[^ref-5]

Unlike its predecessor, the game removes the driving mini-game sequences that required players to manually navigate streets. Instead, players simply type "drive to [location]" for automatic travel between destinations.[^ref-14] This streamlined approach allows the game to focus on its investigation and puzzle-solving elements rather than navigation challenges.

### Structure and Progression

The game follows a linear investigation structure that takes Sonny Bonds through various crime scenes and locations as he pursues Jesse Bains. The player is required to follow correct police procedures to effectively complete the game and achieve the maximum score of 300 points.[^ref-4]

- **Lytton Police Station:** The game begins at the police department where Bonds must check in, retrieve his equipment, and learn about Bains's escape[^ref-14]
- **Various Crime Scenes:** Investigation takes Bonds to multiple murder scenes where evidence must be collected forensically[^ref-10]
- **Cotton Cove:** A critical crime scene requiring detailed evidence gathering[^ref-14]
- **Lytton Airport:** Features a tense airplane sequence including a potential hijacking situation[^ref-13]
- **Underwater Sequence:** A diving section requiring proper equipment and procedure[^ref-13]
- **Final Confrontation:** The warehouse showdown with Bains requiring rescue of Marie[^ref-14]

The game implements a five-minute timer for certain critical missions including the Jail, Mall, Cotton Cove, and Warehouse sequences, adding tension to the procedural gameplay.[^ref-15]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The puzzle design emphasizes realistic police procedures over abstract adventure game logic. Players must perform tasks that actual officers would face, such as properly sighting a firearm at the shooting range before it can be used effectively, obtaining search warrants, and correctly processing crime scenes.[^ref-16] One reviewer noted: "It might be the most down-to-earth, straightforward adventure game I've played."[^ref-16]

The game requires meticulous attention to proper protocol. Sonny Bonds has access to a firearm that must be sighted properly and loaded with ammunition—specifically, the player needs at least 2 bullets for an airplane incident and 4 bullets to defeat Bains in the finale.[^ref-15] The motel sequence causes Sonny to lose his aim, requiring the gun to be sighted again at the shooting range.[^ref-15]

Evidence collection plays a central role, with players required to properly gather and document forensic evidence linking Bains to various crimes.[^ref-10] The game also features copy protection through convict ID verification at the start, requiring reference to the game manual, though a CTRL+M bypass exists.[^ref-14]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Computer Gaming World gave the game enthusiastic praise in their 1989 review, awarding it a score of 4.09 out of 5.00 based on 53 votes. The publication declared: "The advanced graphics, intriguing story, and flowing animation make this story come alive. The whole package leads us toward a new apex in interactive game fiction!"[^ref-2] The reviewer noted: "It is obvious that in this game as in its predecessor, Jim Walls' 'on the job' experiences add to the element of realism and danger that are evident throughout the game."[^ref-2]

Atari ST User awarded the game 9/10 in their June 1989 review, calling it "excellent in every respect – the graphics, plot, detail, humour and story telling are of first rate quality."[^ref-1] The game received similar positive responses across multiple platforms, establishing it as one of Sierra's premier adventure titles of the late 1980s.

### Modern Assessment

Adventure Gamers provided a retrospective review scoring the game 4.5 out of 5 stars, describing it as "an entertaining and intense retro adventure that is not only the best of its series, but one of the very best of Sierra's Golden Age."[^ref-3] The site called it "a crown jewel of its era" that "stands decisively now twenty years after its release as the best game of its series."[^ref-3]

Hardcore Gaming 101 offered similar retrospective praise: "if there's any one title (of the Police Quest series) that deserves attention, it's this one. It's well-paced, fairly exciting, and more interesting than any of the others, and something of an overlooked classic."[^ref-1]

However, not all retrospective reviews were uniformly positive. A Force For Good gave the game 4/10 in 2009, noting that "as a game it's certainly not terrible, and can be mildly diverting at times, but the functional story and fiddly gameplay ultimately make for a less than exciting experience."[^ref-17] The reviewer also observed that "Sierra's decision to produce a shiny VGA remake of the first game has left this one as the poor relation of the series."[^ref-17]

Retro Freak Reviews offered modern praise, stating the game "outshines the original" and "marks a significant advancement over its predecessor, featuring impressive presentation, engaging gameplay, and a compelling story with well-crafted dialogue."[^ref-18]

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** 7.3/10 (Critics 72%, 83 player ratings)[^ref-6]
- **IMDB:** 7.5/10 (73 ratings)[^ref-19]
- **IGN User Rating:** 7.7/10[^ref-8]
- **GOG User Rating:** 4.4/5 (as part of collection)[^ref-20]
- **My Abandonware:** 4.41/5 (39 votes)[^ref-11]
- **Amazon Customer Reviews:** 4.2/5 stars[^ref-7]

In 2011, Adventure Gamers ranked Police Quest II: The Vengeance as the 24th-best adventure game ever released.[^ref-1]

## Development

### Origins

Police Quest II: The Vengeance was created by Jim Walls, a retired California Highway Patrol officer who was recovering from an injury sustained while on duty when he joined Sierra.[^ref-20] The game was conceived as a direct sequel to the successful Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel, continuing the story of Sonny Bonds while taking advantage of Sierra's newly developed SCI engine.[^ref-1]

All of the situations depicted in the game actually happened to Walls or a friend during their law enforcement careers.[^ref-2] Most notably, the antagonist Jesse Bains was based on a real escaped convict whose name was changed for the game—remarkably, the real individual was still at large when the game was released.[^ref-2] Walls explained the philosophy behind the game's realistic approach: "These kinds of people are actually running around out there, even if we don't want to think about it."[^ref-1]

### Production

Development focused on transitioning the series from the AGI engine to Sierra's new SCI0 (Sierra Creative Interpreter) engine, which offered significant technical improvements including double the resolution of its AGI predecessor, improved EGA graphics, an enhanced text parser, and Roland MT-32 sound capabilities.[^ref-18] The game was the third title to utilize this new engine, following King's Quest IV and Leisure Suit Larry II.[^ref-3]

While Jim Walls provided the authentic police procedural content and overall story direction, Adventure Gamers noted that the actual writing was "likely done by behind-the-scenes writers like Mark Crowe or Josh Mandel rather than Jim Walls himself," who admitted he could only type with two fingers.[^ref-3] Interestingly, unlike the first Police Quest, where Al Lowe was brought in to "punch up the script" resulting in some goofy moments, this did not occur for the sequel, giving Police Quest II a more consistently serious tone.[^ref-16]

**Development Credits:**[^ref-6]
- **Designer:** [[Jim Walls]]
- **Background Artists:** Vu Nguyen, Cheryl Cornelius[^ref-21]
- **Composer:** Mark Seibert[^ref-1]

### Technical Achievements

The transition to the SCI0 engine marked a significant upgrade for the Police Quest series. The new engine featured improved EGA graphics with 16 colors and dithering techniques, offering much more vibrant and detailed visuals than the AGI-based original.[^ref-10] The resolution was doubled compared to its predecessor, allowing for more detailed character sprites and environments.[^ref-13]

Mark Seibert composed the soundtrack, which was his first full soundtrack for Sierra On-Line.[^ref-21] The game supported Roland MT-32 audio, providing rich MIDI music for players with the appropriate hardware.[^ref-18] The music was later included in Sierra's 1992 Soundtrack Collection CD.[^ref-22]

### Cut Content

The driving mini-game that was a prominent feature of the first Police Quest was removed for the sequel. Where players previously had to manually navigate the streets of Lytton, driving sequences between destinations became automatic in Police Quest II.[^ref-4] This change allowed the game to focus more heavily on its investigation and forensic elements.[^ref-10]

### Technical Issues

Players have reported several technical issues with Police Quest II. The game can result in unwinnable states if certain actions are not performed or objects are not obtained during specific segments—for example, failing to collect necessary items in the first half can make the second half impossible to complete.[^ref-18]

The CGA version presented particular difficulties, with some objects being "almost impossible to see" in the scuba diving scene due to color limitations.[^ref-13] Additionally, a pipe in the sewers section has a 50/50 chance of pushing the player into sewage.[^ref-15]

The first release version may have a bug where only 3 bullets instead of 4 are needed to defeat Bains, though later versions require the full 4 bullets.[^ref-15] Copy protection issues have also been reported by users attempting to play without the original manual.[^ref-11]

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

Police Quest II contains several hidden references and Easter eggs typical of Sierra's adventure games:

- **Larry Laffer Cameo:** In the Lytton Airport, on the second floor after passing through the metal detector, talking to the man furthest to the right on the couch reveals him to be "Larry Laffer" from Leisure Suit Larry, accompanied by a quick rendition of "For Your Thighs Only."[^ref-6][^ref-14]

- **Sierra Product Placement:** Players who "hack" into the office computers can discover an option to review Sierra's current adventure lineup.[^ref-3]

- **The Gremlin Revealed:** The game reveals that Laura Watts, Sonny's narcotics partner from the first game, was "the Gremlin" that antagonized Dooley—a payoff for fans of the original.[^ref-6]

- **Jim Walls Creator Cameo:** The creator Jim Walls appears in the opening, shown wanted "for excessive verbosity," with the caption "FORGIVE ME FOR SHOUTING-"[^ref-9]

- **Victor Simms Reference:** The Victor Simms picture from the manual is a reference to Planet of the Apes ("Get your stinkin' paws off me, you damned dirty ape!")[^ref-6]

- **Sierra Customer Support:** Players can call Sierra customer support in-game, and can also attempt to call the BBS line.[^ref-9]

- **King Graham Reference:** Going "crazy with gun" triggers a King Graham reference from King's Quest.[^ref-9]

- **"Let's Roll" Phrase:** The game contains the phrase "Let's Roll" pre-dating its famous association with 9/11. As one guide author noted: "Pre-9/11 you would not have heard about this term much and it is more of a coincidence it appears in the game."[^ref-14]

**Japanese PC-98 Version:**
The NEC PC-9801 version became notorious for its extensively modified presentation. All characters were redrawn in an anime-esque style featuring large, colorful eyes and distinctive hairstyles, with more vibrant colors throughout.[^ref-1][^ref-9] This represented one of the most dramatic localizations of a Sierra game for the Japanese market.

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Police Quest II contributed to the overall success of the Police Quest franchise, which sold over 1.2 million copies across five titles by March 1996 according to Sierra On-Line's SEC filings.[^ref-25] The first four Police Quest games specifically totaled 850,000 sales by late 1995.[^ref-1]

The game's realistic approach to police procedures had an unexpected impact beyond entertainment. According to multiple sources, "real police stations would have copies of the game on their computers to give rookies a feeling of what kind of mindset real police officers needed to have."[^ref-13] GOG.com user reviews similarly noted: "consider the many law enforcement agencies that used the series as a training tool."[^ref-20]

The game's influence on players was significant—one reviewer stated: "This game was nearly responsible for me becoming a police officer."[^ref-13]

### Collections

Police Quest II: The Vengeance has appeared in numerous compilation releases:[^ref-21]

- **Triple Adventure Pack**
- **Sierra's Value Pack 2**
- **Police Quest Collection (Daryl F. Gates'): The 4 Most Wanted**
- **Police Quest Collection Series**
- **SWAT: Career Pack**
- **Police Quest Collection (XP)**
- **Police Quest 1+2+3+4** (GOG.com digital release)[^ref-20]

### Fan Projects

The game is playable through ScummVM, providing modern compatibility for preservation purposes.[^ref-23] Various fan walkthroughs have been created, including specialized guides such as a "minimum points" walkthrough that demonstrates alternate completion paths and reveals "how much extra fluff and padding they do put into these sort of games when there is not as much plot-related content."[^ref-15]

### Related Publications

- **The Police Quest Casebook:** Written by Peter Scisco, published by Osborne McGraw-Hill in 1993. A strategy guide covering the first three Police Quest games.[^ref-26]
- **Police Quest 2 Hint Book:** Official Sierra hint book providing progressive hints and solutions[^ref-27]
- **Game Manual:** Included mug shots for copy protection verification, with the Victor Simms picture containing a hidden Planet of the Apes reference[^ref-6]

### Critical Perspective

Police Quest II: The Vengeance occupies a unique position in adventure gaming history as one of the first "serious" adventure games—a genre precursor to later narrative-driven titles like Gabriel Knight.[^ref-3] While Sierra's other major series dealt with fantasy kingdoms, comedic situations, or space exploration, Police Quest offered a grounded experience that asked players to think like actual law enforcement officers.

The game represents the Police Quest series at its creative peak, balancing Jim Walls' authentic police procedural knowledge with improved technology and tighter storytelling. As Adventure Gamers noted, it "set the standard for the serious adventure game" in an era when the genre was dominated by lighter fare.[^ref-3] However, its reliance on the text parser interface and lack of a VGA remake (unlike the first game) has left it somewhat overlooked by modern audiences, making it what one reviewer called "the poor relation of the series."[^ref-17]

The game's legacy extends beyond entertainment into actual law enforcement training, demonstrating the potential for games to serve educational purposes while remaining engaging experiences. This dual nature—entertainment and training tool—makes Police Quest II a historically significant title in the evolution of the adventure game genre and interactive media more broadly.
