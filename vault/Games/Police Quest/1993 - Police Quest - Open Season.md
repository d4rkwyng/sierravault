## Overview

Police Quest: Open Season, released in 1993, marked a radical departure from the established Police Quest series[^ref-1]. Developed by Sierra On-Line under the guidance of former LAPD Chief Daryl F. Gates, this fourth installment abandoned the story arc of the previous three games, introducing a new setting and a new protagonist, homicide detective John Carey of the Los Angeles Police Department[^ref-2]. The game emerged during the golden era of DOS gaming, captivating audiences with its unique blend of law enforcement themes and interactive storytelling[^ref-3].

As part of Ken Williams' ambitious Reality Role-Playing series, the game represented Sierra's attempt to create serious simulations of real-world events rather than traditional games[^ref-4]. Williams explained his vision: "I want to find the top cop, lawyer, airline pilot, fireman, race-car driver, politician, military hero, schoolteacher, white-water rafter, mountain climber, etc., and have them work with us on a simulation of their world. Chief Gates gives us the cop game"[^ref-4]. This philosophy resulted in Sierra's first fully photo-realistic game, featuring digitized backgrounds of actual Los Angeles locations and real actors instead of traditional 2D art[^ref-47].

## Story Summary

The game opens with a shocking crime scene that sets the tone for its gritty realism: "The tortured and tormented body of Bob Hickman, LAPD, lies lifeless among the alley debris. An obvious case of felonious homicide"[^ref-6]. Detective John Carey must investigate the murder of his best friend Officer Bob Hickman and 8-year-old Bobby Washington, whose body is found in a dumpster at the start of the game[^ref-7]. As one reviewer noted, "the game's gritty realism greatly depicts the gory life of a homicide detective. This in turn made some scenarios down-right gruesome to investigate"[^ref-7].

The story involves Carey tracking down a mass murderer, which takes elements from several books, such as Silence of the Lambs[^ref-7]. The killer is believed to be based on Jeffrey Dahmer[^ref-8], adding another layer of real-world inspiration to the game's disturbing narrative. Throughout the investigation, players must follow proper LAPD procedures while navigating the harsh realities of urban crime in Los Angeles.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Police Quest: Open Season utilized Sierra's new SCI2 engine and featured a point-and-click interface[^ref-9]. The game meticulously crafted gameplay that seamlessly combines strategic decision-making with immersive puzzle-solving[^ref-3]. Unlike previous Sierra games, the maximum score does not appear in either version, making it difficult for players to track their progress traditionally[^ref-8].

The game required players to follow authentic police procedures with unprecedented detail. As one reviewer explained, "You can't just go guns blazing like you're playing Narc! You have to observe the correct procedure in each specific case and apply it"[^ref-10]. All the correct procedures, along with the penal and radio codes, were so highly detailed in the manual that it probably could pass off as an official police academy manual[^ref-10].

### Structure and Progression

The game's scoring system was based entirely on following standard operating procedures correctly[^ref-11]. Players received feedback when they deviated from proper police protocol, with messages like "Deadly use of force was not tactically correct!" appearing when inappropriate actions were taken[^ref-12]. This realistic approach meant that "the sheer level of realism in this game is groundbreaking, if not a bit annoying at times"[^ref-13].

The investigation took players through multiple floors of Parker Center (LAPD headquarters), which were recreated in the game with meticulous detail[^ref-14]. Chief Gates wanted to keep the game as realistic as possible and insisted on using actual LA locations[^ref-15]. Sierra gained cooperation from LAPD and mayor's office through Gates' involvement, allowing photography of authentic locations including Parker Center, county morgue, civic center, and police academy[^ref-16].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The game featured complex investigative puzzles that required proper evidence collection and police procedure. Player choices throughout the game could lead to different outcomes, adding replay value and depth to the experience[^ref-3]. However, as one critic noted, "The main problem with all the Police Quest games is that if you miss a event or a item you will get hung up and have no way to complete the game"[^ref-17].

The realistic approach extended to character interactions and dialogue. As Daryl Gates explained in a 1994 Vibe magazine interview about advising Sierra writers: "I told them that these people people use the same language as you and I"[^ref-12], though Sierra's writers included stereotypical dialogue despite Gates advising against it[^ref-18].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| MobyGames Critics | 73% | [^ref-19] |
| GameSpot User Reviews | 6.8/10 | [^ref-17] |
| IMDb | 6.7/10 | [^ref-20] |
| My Abandonware | 4.43/5 | [^ref-21] |
| Abandonware DOS | 4.21/5.00 | 85 votes[^ref-1] |
| Just Games Retro | 4/10 average | 2 total votes[^ref-22] |

The mature subject matter and photo-realistic graphics resulted in an MA-17 listing from the ESRB rating system when it was established in 1994.[^ref-47]

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospective reviews have been largely critical of the game. Adventure Gamers gave it only 2 stars, concluding that "there are some good elements that shine through occasionally, but generally the game is not a positive experience"[^ref-23]. The review criticized the "voice acting Ed Wood would love" and noted that "with a conclusion that borders on incomprehensible, Police Quest 4 offers impressive technological advances from previous games in the series, but loses their simpler charms"[^ref-23].

Alex Bevilacqua was even harsher in his 2024 retrospective, giving the game 40% and stating "The graphics are blocky and just overall look shitty" and "Sierra should have left this series alone after Police Quest 3"[^ref-24]. Space Quest Historian described the game as a "depressingly goofy trainwreck" with "mushy, pixelated" graphics and an "absolute slog" of gameplay[^ref-25].

However, some reviewers found merit in the game's ambitious approach. One MobyGames user noted that it was "very much ahead of its time. It attempts to provide an interactive and realistic experience as to what a police detective actually does during a murder investigation. This is years before, 'Grand Theft Auto' would attempt a similar interactive and realistic experience"[^ref-26].

## Development

### Origins

The game's development began after Jim Walls, creator of the original Police Quest series, left Sierra. As Walls explained on his personal website: "after PQ 3, circumstances developed causing me to decide it was time that I leave"[^ref-27]. Ken Williams wanted the police games to transition into tactical simulations more than just being interactive stories, leading him to seek out Daryl Gates, who had knowledge of police procedures and tactics that were well beyond what any one field officer could bring to the table[^ref-14].

Former LA Police Chief Daryl F. Gates joined the Sierra team to show gamers the true face of police work[^ref-28]. Gates, who had recently resigned following the 1992 LA riots, served primarily as a technical advisor rather than the actual designer[^ref-29]. The real creative force behind the game was Tammy Dargan, a former producer on the TV show America's Most Wanted, who served as producer, director, designer, and writer[^ref-29].

### Production

The development team utilized revolutionary technology for its time. They digitally photographed each scene and scanned them into the computer[^ref-30], creating what would become Sierra's first fully photo-realistic game[^ref-31]. The game used motion capture technology on real actors[^ref-32] and featured actual digital stills from locations around Los Angeles[^ref-33].

The voice cast included Brandon Massey as Detective John Carey, Andrew Witches as Mitchell Thurman, and Jeff Bianchi as Sam Nobles[^ref-20]. Several Sierra On-Line employees also appeared as actors, including Dana Dean (animator), Barry T. Smith (animator and writer), Rod Fung (cinematographer), and Neal Grandstaff (music)[^ref-8]. The game featured extensive voice acting, with the CD version containing 10,000 lines of dialogue[^ref-34].

### Technical Achievements

Police Quest: Open Season was the first game to use Sierra's SCI2 engine[^ref-35] and represented a major technological leap forward. It was the first Sierra game to feature photo-realistic backgrounds, long before the likes of Phantasmagoria and its sequel[^ref-36]. The team used photoshots of real L.A. exteriors and interiors, motion capture technology, and different voice actors from motion capture actors[^ref-37].

The game came with a 54-page abridged version of the actual LAPD operations handbook[^ref-38], which contained detailed regulations such as "the prescribed trousers belt shall be worn under the Police Equipment Belt. It shall be adjusted so that no part other than the top edge is visible"[^ref-14]. This manual served as both a reference guide and an attempt to add authenticity to the gaming experience.

### Voice Cast

The CD-ROM version featured extensive voice acting with over 10,000 lines of dialogue.[^ref-34] Several Sierra employees also appeared as actors in the game.[^ref-8]

### Version History

| Version | Date | Platform | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| 1.0 | Late 1993 | DOS | Original floppy release[^ref-1] |
| CD-ROM | 1994 | DOS/Windows | Full voice acting, 10,000+ lines[^ref-34] |
| 1.0 | 1994 | Mac OS | Macintosh release[^ref-1] |
| Digital | 2011 | Windows | GOG.com release as part of Police Quest Collection[^ref-40] |

## Legacy

Police Quest: Open Season marked the end of the traditional Police Quest adventure game series, though the franchise would continue with the SWAT tactical series[^ref-38]. By 1995, the first four Police Quest games had sold a combined 850,000 copies[^ref-47]. The game's attempt to blend serious police simulation with adventure gaming was ambitious but ultimately unsuccessful in winning over critics and fans of the original series.

Despite its critical reception, the game's technological innovations were significant. As PC Gamer's Andy Kelly noted in a retrospective review: "There's no doubt about it: this is a bad game. But it's an interesting one too"[^ref-12]. The game's use of photo-realistic backgrounds and real locations would influence future Sierra productions and the broader adventure game industry.

The game also serves as a historical artifact of early 1990s attitudes toward policing and urban crime. As Jimmy Maher noted in The Digital Antiquarian: "the jingoistic Gates game is a prime case in point" when discussing games that failed to handle complex social questions with appropriate nuance[^ref-4].
