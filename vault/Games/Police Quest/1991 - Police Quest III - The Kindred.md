# Police Quest III: The Kindred

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

Police Quest III: The Kindred is a 1991 police procedural adventure game developed and published by Sierra On-Line, marking the third installment in the Police Quest series and the final entry designed by former California Highway Patrol officer [[Jim Walls]][^ref-1]. The game continues the story of Detective Sergeant Sonny Bonds in the fictional city of Lytton, now grown into a fully-fledged metropolis with an increased crime rate to match[^ref-2]. Unlike its text-parser predecessors, Police Quest III introduced a completely mouse-driven point-and-click interface, representing Sierra's transition to their new generation of adventure games[^ref-3].

The game was notable for being the first Sierra title to extensively utilize digitized character technology in the VGA era, with close-up images showcasing pixelated versions of actual actors[^ref-4]. Composer Jan Hammer, famous for his work on the Miami Vice television soundtrack, provided the game's "searing music-card compatible stereo soundtrack," lending the game a contemporary cop drama atmosphere[^ref-5]. Sierra marketed the Police Quest series as "the most accurate simulation of police action you can get," claiming it was "so realistic it's used by police departments across the country as a training tool"[^ref-5].

The development of Police Quest III was marked by significant behind-the-scenes turmoil, as [[Jim Walls]] departed Sierra during the late stages of production under circumstances that "have still not been publicly explained"[^ref-3]. [[Jane Jensen]], who would later achieve fame as the creator of the Gabriel Knight series, was brought in to finalize the writing for the unfinished game, marking her first writing assignment at Sierra[^ref-4]. Despite these difficulties, contemporary reviews praised the game as "the best of the series to date," though later retrospectives have been considerably more critical of its rushed development and incomplete feel[^ref-6].

## Story Summary

Since the events of Police Quest II: The Vengeance, Sonny Bonds and Marie Wilkans have married, and Sonny has been promoted to the rank of Sergeant in the Lytton Police Department[^ref-2]. The game opens with tragedy when Marie is viciously stabbed in a mall parking lot, leaving her in a coma and setting the stage for Sonny's most personal case yet[^ref-3]. As the game's official description puts it: "Your wife's been viciously stabbed. You're at the breaking point, bent on revenge. Can you keep your temper and follow professional police procedure?"[^ref-5]

The investigation reveals that Marie's attack is connected to a series of gruesome murders perpetrated by a sinister cult known as "The Kindred"[^ref-9]. Sonny must navigate not only the cult investigation but also deal with a cocaine cartel operating in Lytton, adding layers of complexity to the criminal conspiracy[^ref-2].

The case takes a darker turn with the appearance of Michael Bains[^ref-2]. The connection between the Bains family and The Kindred creates a web of vengeance that makes Sonny's investigation deeply personal on multiple levels.

> [!warning]- Major Spoilers
> **Partner Betrayal:** Throughout the investigation, Sonny encounters a corrupt partner whose betrayal threatens to derail his efforts to bring justice[^ref-2].
> 
> **Villain Connection:** Michael Bains is the brother of Jesse Bains—the drug lord who Sonny killed at the climax of Police Quest II[^ref-2]. The game's manual sets the tone with the note: "There's no way officer bonds could have brought bains back alive," referencing the controversial conclusion to the previous game[^ref-10].

The narrative explores the tension between Sonny's desire for revenge and his professional obligation to follow proper police procedures, a theme central to the Police Quest series' identity as a realistic police simulation[^ref-5]. As the investigation progresses, Sonny must piece together clues, interview witnesses, and build a case against The Kindred while maintaining his composure despite the attack on his wife.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Police Quest III marked a significant departure from its predecessors by introducing a completely mouse-driven point-and-click interface, eliminating the text parser that had defined the first two games in the series[^ref-3]. This transition aligned with Sierra's broader movement toward more accessible adventure game interfaces during the early 1990s[^ref-6]. The game utilizes Sierra's SCI1 engine, representing the company's updated technology for VGA-era adventures[^ref-7].

The interface features video-captured human actors with "life-like action sequences" and "hand-painted, digitized color scenes and graphics"[^ref-5]. Players interact with the environment through a point-and-click system described as a "hands-on, no-typing interface," making it more accessible to players who found text parsers frustrating[^ref-5]. The game was praised for this interface improvement, with Computer Gaming World noting that "the parserless interface enhances playability so much that even those who did not care for earlier Sierra releases may want to try the new generation"[^ref-6].

### Structure and Progression

The game follows Sonny Bonds through multiple days of investigation, with the narrative progressing as players complete required objectives and gather evidence. Police Quest III emphasizes realistic police procedures throughout, "requiring players to think critically and make informed decisions that impact the story's progression"[^ref-11]. The game manual establishes the tone with the observation that "being a cop is ninety-five percent boredom," though the gameplay focuses primarily on the exciting five percent[^ref-10].

Key locations and investigation phases include:

- **Lytton Police Station:** Central hub where Sonny reports for duty, accesses computer systems, and coordinates with fellow officers
- **Oak Tree Mall:** Crime scene where Marie was attacked, requiring careful evidence collection
- **Hospital:** Where Marie remains in a coma, providing emotional stakes throughout the investigation
- **Various Crime Scenes:** Locations tied to The Kindred's murder spree requiring forensic examination
- **City Streets:** Patrol areas requiring navigation via the game's driving system

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Police Quest III combines traditional adventure game inventory puzzles with police-procedural mechanics that demand attention to proper law enforcement protocols[^ref-11]. Players must conduct computer work, use facial composite software to create suspect sketches, and analyze murder patterns using maps[^ref-9]. Evidence collection and proper handling procedures remain crucial, as in previous entries.

The game features a driving system that allows players to patrol Lytton's expanded streets, though this mechanic proved controversial. Adventure Classic Gaming noted that "plainly speaking, driving around in the town of Lytton is a disaster"[^ref-4]. The system requires players to navigate while maintaining appropriate speeds, with the inability to turn when driving faster than 55 mph[^ref-12]. Adventure Gamers memorably stated: "You haven't played Police Quest 3 until you've driven straight into the river immediately after leaving the station, for lack of understanding how quickly you must click to successfully turn"[^ref-13].

The game's ending depends on player choices throughout, including seemingly minor decisions. One reviewer noted that the "final ending trigger can fail if you issue warning rather than ticket on very first day," demonstrating the game's sometimes obscure cause-and-effect relationships[^ref-13].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Police Quest III received mixed to positive reviews upon release, with critical assessment varying significantly between publications. Computer Gaming World's J.D. Lambright called it "the best of the series to date," praising its replayability: "every time one tries to do something differently, something new will pop up that the player did not see during the first experience"[^ref-6]. Games-X magazine awarded a perfect 5/5 score in November 1991, reviewed by Brian Sharp[^ref-14].

French magazine Génération 4 gave the PC version 93% in November 1991, with reviewer Didier Latil[^ref-14]. Joystick magazine similarly awarded 90%, reviewed by Dany Boolauck in the same month[^ref-14]. Swedish publication Datormagazin gave the Amiga version a remarkable 95% in May 1992, reviewed by Göran Fröjdh[^ref-14].

However, not all reviews were enthusiastic. Zero magazine gave a more modest 79% in January 1992, reviewed by Mike Gerrard[^ref-14]. Dragon magazine was notably harsh, awarding only 2 out of 5 stars in February 1992, reviewed by Hartley Lesser, Patricia Lesser, and Kirk Lesser[^ref-1]. German publication PC Games noted that "interest on the part of the gamer fell slightly" compared to previous entries[^ref-1]. Amiga Joker gave 64% in June-July 1992, reviewed by Joachim Nettelbeck[^ref-14].

Later budget re-releases saw even more polarized reception. Amiga Action awarded 92% in December 1994[^ref-14], while CU Amiga Magazine gave 90% in February 1995[^ref-14]. However, Amiga Power gave only 51% in January 1995, reviewed by Paul Mellerick[^ref-14], and The One Amiga was particularly critical with just 32% in February 1995, reviewed by Harry Attrill[^ref-14].

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospectives have been considerably more critical of Police Quest III. Adventure Classic Gaming's Scott Bruner awarded 2 of 5 stars in January 2014, calling it "a soulless and disappointing affair" despite acknowledging it as "the most technically polished title in the original series"[^ref-4]. The review concluded that "despite the technical improvements in the interface and graphics, the game falters due to a dearth of ideas and imagination"[^ref-4].

Adventure Gamers similarly awarded 2 stars, stating that "The Kindred is simply a disappointment that even nostalgia can't completely wash away"[^ref-13]. The review noted that "to say The Kindred fails at storytelling is a healthy understatement," though acknowledging "it is really fun to be a cop"[^ref-13]. The Space Quest Historian's retrospective was particularly harsh, describing the game as a "disappointing half-baked idea of a game where nearly every facet feels rushed and incomplete" and a "hair-pulling combination of utter tedium and frustrating gotcha moments," ultimately calling it "wet fart of a game" with "the worst ending he's ever seen"[^ref-15].

However, fan reception has remained warmer. User reviews on MobyGames include praise such as "This is my favorite PQ game, it combines my favorite part of PQ1 (the regular mundane cop stuff) with all of PQ2's detective stuff, adds great graphics, a great soundtrack, and a great story, and makes a nearly perfect game"[^ref-8]. Another user noted "PQ3 remains my favorite of the series. It combines the elements of both of the previous games"[^ref-8].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames Critics:** 75-76% (24 ratings)[^ref-8]
- **MobyGames Players:** 3.7/5[^ref-8]
- **IMDB:** 7.6/10 (82 votes)[^ref-16]
- **My Abandonware:** 4.2/5 (80 votes)[^ref-17]

## Development

### Origins

Police Quest III: The Kindred emerged as the continuation of Sierra's successful police procedural adventure series, designed to showcase the company's new SCI1 engine and VGA graphics capabilities[^ref-7]. The game's events were based partially on actual experiences from Jim Walls' career as a California Highway Patrol officer, continuing the series' emphasis on authenticity[^ref-18]. As Walls noted in promotional materials: "I managed to survive them. Let's see if YOU can do as well under pressure"[^ref-19].

Sierra sought to give the game a contemporary cop drama feel, hiring Jan Hammer specifically because of his iconic Miami Vice soundtrack work[^ref-5]. User reviews noted that "Sierra was trying for a Miami Vice type game" with this entry[^ref-20].

### Production

The development of Police Quest III was significantly disrupted by Jim Walls' departure from Sierra during the late stages of production. The circumstances of his leaving "have still not been publicly explained" according to ClassicReload.com[^ref-3]. Adventure Gamers noted that "series creator Jim Walls left under controversial circumstances with game substantially unfinished"[^ref-13]. Unusually, Mark Crowe received credit as Director while Jim Walls received only fifth billing as Designer, suggesting a complicated production history[^ref-13].

Jane Jensen was brought in to finalize the writing, marking her first professional assignment at Sierra before she went on to write King's Quest VI and create the Gabriel Knight series[^ref-4][^ref-8]. The Space Quest Historian described the game as "rushed out the door before it was ready," characterizing it as a "botched production"[^ref-15].

**Development Credits:**[^ref-8]
- **Designer:** James Walls
- **Writer:** [[Jane Jensen]] (finalizing script)
- **Director:** [[Mark Crowe]]
- **Producer:** Guruka Singh-Khalsa
- **Composer:** Jan Hammer
- **Sound Effects:** Rob Atesalp, Mark Seibert[^ref-21]
- **Music Arrangement:** Dan Kehler[^ref-21]

Several Sierra employees appeared in the game as digitized characters, including Josh Mandel and Corey Cole, who portrayed the police psychiatrist[^ref-8][^ref-13].

### Technical Achievements

Police Quest III represented several technical firsts for Sierra. It was "the first Sierra game to really make use of digitized character technology in the VGA era," with close-up images showcasing pixelated versions of actual actors[^ref-4][^ref-13]. The game offered both 16-color versions (supporting EGA, MCGA, VGA, and Tandy/PCjr displays) and 256-color versions (supporting MCGA and VGA)[^ref-8].

The game supported multiple sound cards including AdLib, Game Blaster, Roland MT-32/LAPC-1/CM-32L, Sound Blaster, ThunderBoard Pro, and Audio Spectrum[^ref-4]. Jan Hammer's original score took full advantage of these options, providing what Sierra marketed as "a searing music-card compatible stereo soundtrack"[^ref-5].

### Technical Specifications

**DOS Version:**[^ref-22]
- **Operating System:** MS-DOS 3.3 or greater
- **Processor:** 8088/8086 or better (286 or better recommended)
- **Memory:** 640K RAM
- **Storage:** 5.5 MB hard drive space
- **Graphics:** EGA, VGA (16 and 256 color versions available)

**Media Formats:**[^ref-4][^ref-8]
- 4 × 5.25" high-density floppy disks
- 5 × 3.5" floppy disks (720KB DD or HD versions available)

### Cut Content

A CD-ROM version of Police Quest III with full speech was planned but "never came to fruition"[^ref-8]. This would have added voice acting to the entire game, similar to Sierra's later CD-ROM enhanced releases of other titles. The cancellation of this version meant Police Quest III remained a text-only experience, unlike the subsequent Police Quest: Open Season which featured full voice acting.

### Version History

### Technical Issues

Police Quest III suffers from significant compatibility issues on modern systems. The SierraHelp website documents multiple known problems including "poor quality or no sound," "unable to initialize your audio hardware" errors, and speed-related issues where "police car moves way too quickly to drive easily"[^ref-22]. One walkthrough author warned: "There are serious timing errors in this game if you are playing on a modern PC so try using an emulator such as DosBox, play on an older PC (486) or better yet find the unofficial SCI fixes that will sort out most problems. If none of the above are an option for you it might make the game unplayable"[^ref-12].

Specific bugs include:
- Car speed issues when Morales asks you to drive to the mall[^ref-22]
- Missing visual cues for the police station entrance, mall entrance, or freeway on ramp when passing by[^ref-22]
- Pentagram problem when using a keyboard[^ref-22]
- Dialog boxes displaying for only a few seconds with no text speed adjustment[^ref-8]
- Game-Breaking Bug in the "Connect the Deaths" puzzle in early versions causing the game to become unwinnable[^ref-19]
- General instability with the game "quite unstable and likely to crash every once in a while"[^ref-20]
- Sound driver selection issues where "one of the sound drivers didn't have sirens correct or Jan Hammer's awesome beats"[^ref-17]

The driving system also functioned as a form of copy protection, requiring players to navigate correctly or face frustrating consequences[^ref-4].

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- Jim Walls' name appears on the in-game computer as part of the "Designer division" of LPD with the code name "Ice Man"[^ref-19]
- The end credits list "Jim 'Pretty Boy' Walls" as part of an electronic terrorist group[^ref-19]
- Several Sierra employees portrayed characters, including Josh Mandel and Corey Cole (as the police psychiatrist)[^ref-8][^ref-13]
- Dr. Sidney Aimes delivers the memorable line: "Would you mind not playing with my balls, please?"[^ref-19]
- A jail guard quips: "You mean to tell me you fished that outta this guy's shorts? You've got some guts, Bonds"[^ref-19]
- The game takes place in 1991, three years after Police Quest II[^ref-19]
- This marked Mark Crowe's final game at Sierra before he transferred to Dynamix[^ref-19]
- The front cover states that PQ3 has "mature adult subject matter"[^ref-8]
- A Sega CD port was announced but never released[^ref-1]

### Multiple Endings

The game features variations in its ending based on player actions throughout the investigation. One significant variable involves whether the player issues a ticket or warning during a traffic stop on the very first day—this seemingly minor choice can affect the final outcome[^ref-13]. The Space Quest Historian singled out the ending as "the worst ending he's ever seen," suggesting the rushed development resulted in an unsatisfying conclusion regardless of which variables the player achieves[^ref-15].

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Police Quest III contributed to the overall success of Sierra's Police Quest franchise. According to Sierra On-Line's SEC 10-K filing from March 1996, "the first four Police Quest games totaled 850,000 sales by late 1995"[^ref-1]. By the end of March 1996, "combined sales of the Police Quest series surpassed 1.2 million units"[^ref-25]. The filing described the series as one where "a cop fights cunning and dangerous criminals and solves intriguing cases while following correct police procedures"[^ref-25].

The game received the Enchanted Realms Distinctive Adventure Award in January 1992 (issue #9)[^ref-8].

### Collections

Police Quest III has been included in several compilation releases:
- **Police Quest Collection** (1997)[^ref-5]
- **Police Quest Collection Series**[^ref-5]
- **SWAT Career Pack**[^ref-5]

The game remains available digitally through GOG.com and Steam as part of the Police Quest Collection, running via DOSBox emulation[^ref-7].

### Fan Projects

A German language patch was created by fan "BumbleBee" specifically for the Steam "Police Quest Collection," providing full German localization of "all menus and other texts"[^ref-26]. Additionally, a Russian fan translation was created by «Бюро переводов Old-Games.Ru»[^ref-7]. A fan arrangement album titled "Sierra Symphony Vol 1 - Police Quest III" was released on December 19, 2014[^ref-21].

### Amiga Port & SCP Enhancement

Sierra's Amiga port of Police Quest III, released in 1992 via U.S. Gold and re-released in 1994 via Kixx XL, suffered from the same graphical compromises that plagued all Sierra SCI engine Amiga conversions.[^ref-8][^ref-14]

In January 2026, the [[2025 - SCP Sierra Conversion Project|Sierra Conversion Project (SCP)]] released an enhanced version with all graphics improved and tested to completion—the first SCP project to achieve full completion.[^ref-31] Graphics were modified by kikems with assistance from DaRaSCo using Amiga-native tools including ImageFX, PPaint, and Adpro.[^ref-31] As team member Estrayk noted: "kikems used Amiga tools to prove that Sierra didn't do better in those years because they didn't want to, not because the tools didn't exist."[^ref-31]

### Critical Perspective

Police Quest III occupies a complicated position in Sierra's adventure game history. On one hand, it represented significant technical advancement with its VGA graphics, digitized characters, and streamlined point-and-click interface[^ref-4]. Computer Gaming World's assessment that it was "the best of the series to date" reflected genuine appreciation for these improvements[^ref-6]. The game's contemporary review scores, ranging from 79% to 95% in major publications, indicated solid commercial and critical success upon release[^ref-14].

However, the troubled development left lasting scars. The departure of Jim Walls, whose real-world police experience had been central to the series' identity, and the rushed completion by Jane Jensen (talented though she was) resulted in a game that many retrospective critics view as fundamentally incomplete[^ref-15]. Adventure Classic Gaming's assessment—technically polished but creatively bankrupt—encapsulates the modern critical consensus[^ref-4]. The game marked the effective end of an era: Walls never returned to Sierra, and the subsequent Police Quest: Open Season under Daryl Gates' guidance represented a dramatic departure in tone and approach that proved even more controversial[^ref-30].
