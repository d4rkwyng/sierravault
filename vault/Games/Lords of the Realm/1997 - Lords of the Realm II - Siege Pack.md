# Lords of the Realm II: Siege Pack

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 30, 2026</small>

## Overview

Lords of the Realm II: Siege Pack is the official expansion pack to Lords of the Realm II, released in 1997 by Sierra On-Line[^ref-1]. Developed by Impressions Games, the expansion features several new maps and castles, an all-battle mode where players can defend or attack castles, improved AI, and a map editor[^ref-1]. The expansion was designed to focus on pure combat gameplay, as the marketing description proclaimed: "Declare all-out war with the Lords of the Realm II Siege Pack. Now you can concentrate on just fighting - this is pure combat"[^ref-2].

Set in medieval England in 1268 A.D., the game places players in a struggle for the English throne alongside five other lords[^ref-3]. The Siege Pack adds 20 new maps to the 24 maps of the basic game, along with 50 new battle arenas and support for head-to-head combat on the Internet[^ref-4][^ref-5]. According to David Lester, Impressions Games general manager, "We wanted the game to be more multiplayer friendly, and one way to do that was by adding realtime combat. Besides, when you can bring a castle down by aiming a battering ram or a catapult at it in realtime, it's a lot more satisfying"[^ref-6].

## Story Summary

The English throne lies empty in 1268 A.D., and players find themselves as one of six lords locked in a struggle for the crown[^ref-3]. As the game description states: "When the throne of England sits empty, the sword rules"[^ref-9]. The medieval setting places players in the role of nobles who must manage their territories and armies to conquer neighboring realms before being conquered themselves[^ref-9]. The ultimate goal is clear and unforgiving: "Because in the end, you're either king - or you're dead"[^ref-9]. The political landscape shifts as alliances form and break, requiring players to balance diplomacy with military strength. County conquest involves not just defeating enemy armies but winning over populations, as newly conquered lands may harbor resentment that complicates administration and resource extraction.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Lords of the Realm II: Siege Pack is a mixture of turn-based county and economic management and real-time combat[^ref-7]. The game supports keyboard, mouse, and trackball controls, with the mouse being the primary input device[^ref-8]. Players can engage in both single-player campaigns and multiplayer battles supporting 1-5 players offline and 2 players online through LAN or modem connections[^ref-8].

### Structure and Progression

The expansion pack includes an all-battle mode that allows players to focus purely on combat without the economic management aspects of the base game[^ref-1]. Players can design castles using historical blueprints and engage in siege battles using various medieval weapons[^ref-10]. The game features no magic or technology trees, instead focusing on realistic medieval combat and resource management[^ref-6].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Combat occurs in real-time when players engage enemies in battle, which GameSpot's Tim Soete noted as "when the real fun starts"[^ref-7]. Players must carefully manage their peasants, who "are fairly temperamental" and "get ticked off by things like slight tax increases, food shortages, over-conscripting, and being overworked"[^ref-11]. The game includes complex economic mechanics, including a notable integer rollover glitch where provinces losing around 160 happiness per season from taxes will see the -160 happiness roll over to approximately +120 happiness[^ref-12].

The siege warfare mechanics are the expansion's primary focus. Players can design castles using various wall types, tower configurations, and defensive structures, then test them against AI or human attackers. Siege weapons include catapults, battering rams, and siege towers, each with specific tactical applications. Defenders must position archers on walls, station troops at choke points, and manage oil and rock supplies for pouring on attackers. The all-battle mode allows players to skip the economic management entirely and focus purely on military confrontations.

## Castle Design

One of the Siege Pack's standout features was its castle design system, allowing players to create fortifications using historical blueprints[^ref-10]. Players could position walls, towers, gatehouses, and defensive emplacements according to strategic principles. Castle construction required resources and time, making defensive investment a significant strategic decision. The system encouraged experimentation with different layouts, as some configurations proved more resistant to specific siege tactics. Well-designed castles could repel attacks from superior forces, while poorly planned fortifications crumbled quickly under assault. The ability to save and share castle designs extended the community engagement, with players exchanging effective defensive layouts and challenging each other to breach their creations.

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| GameSpot | 7.6/10 | "The Middle Ages were tough times and similarly, Lords of the Realm II is a tough game"[^ref-11] |
| Hyper | 85% | Reviewed by Dan Toose, February 1997[^ref-6] |
| PC Zone | 80% | Reviewed by Paul Presley, February 1997[^ref-6] |
| Home of the Underdogs | 8.19/10 | "Siege Pack adds more of what made LOTRII a classic"[^ref-13] |
| MyAbandonware | 4.6/5 | "An excellent expansion pack to one of the best medieval strategy games ever made"[^ref-10] |

### Modern Assessment

The game received "generally favorable reviews" according to Metacritic, with an aggregate score of 77%[^ref-6]. MobyGames shows a critics aggregate score of 69%[^ref-1]. Amazon customer reviews rate the game 4.0 out of 5 stars[^ref-5]. PC Gamer praised it as "Immense fun for both the empire-builder and the medieval combatant with all the intrigue and bloodletting you could want," though Computer Games Magazine noted it was "A solid game, but it isn't terribly original"[^ref-14].

## Development

### Origins

Lords of the Realm II was Impressions Games' first major game for Sierra after Sierra's acquisition of the studio[^ref-15]. The expansion pack was developed to address feedback about the original game and make it more multiplayer-friendly through the addition of real-time combat elements[^ref-6].

### Production

The game was composed by Edward Saltzman and Keith Zizza, with a complete soundtrack featuring 65 total audio files totaling 52 minutes and 5 seconds of music[^ref-16]. The development team was led by designers Chris Beatrice, David Lester, Eric Ouellette, and Simon Bradbury[^ref-7]. The game uses the Smacker Video engine for multimedia playback[^ref-8].

### Technical Achievements

The original system requirements included a 486/66 MHz processor, 8MB RAM, Windows 95, local bus video, 10MB hard drive space, and a 2X CD-ROM drive[^ref-8]. The expansion pack required the registered version of Lords of the Realm II to function[^ref-5]. Later compatibility modifications allowed the game to scale to use the entire screen with Direct3D bilinear interpolation for modern systems[^ref-17].

The game utilized the Smacker Video engine[^ref-8] for its cutscenes and introductory sequences, providing high-quality video compression that was impressive for the era. The real-time battle engine rendered hundreds of individual soldiers with distinct animations, creating visually engaging combat sequences that rewarded tactical thinking. The map editor included with the expansion allowed players to create custom scenarios, extending the game's longevity significantly.

### Map Editor

The inclusion of a map editor was a significant feature that set the Siege Pack apart from typical expansion packs. Players could design their own territories, place starting resources, and configure AI opponents. This tool enabled the community to create and share custom scenarios, effectively multiplying the available content. The editor was relatively user-friendly for its time, allowing players without programming experience to construct playable maps within hours of learning the interface.

## Legacy

The Siege Pack expansion was well-received by strategy game fans, with MyAbandonware reviewer HOTUD noting: "If only more expansion packs today give as much bang for your buck. Two thumbs up, way up!"[^ref-10] However, some critics questioned whether an expansion was necessary given the original game's "mediocre success"[^ref-18]. The game maintained commercial success, appearing on PC Data's best-seller lists throughout 1997, including a comeback to number 9 in January 1997 after previously dropping to number 16[^ref-19].

The Lords of the Realm series continued with Lords of the Realm III in 2004, developed by a different team. That sequel received mixed reception and marked the end of the franchise. The Siege Pack and the base game together represent the high point of the series, combining deep economic management with satisfying tactical combat in a historically-grounded setting.

Modern players can experience the game through digital distribution platforms, with the Steam release offering compatibility with contemporary operating systems. The game's combination of turn-based strategy and real-time tactics continues to appeal to players who appreciate medieval settings and hybrid gameplay approaches. The relatively modest system requirements mean the game runs effortlessly on modern hardware, preserving the classic experience for new generations of strategy enthusiasts.

For fans of medieval strategy games, Lords of the Realm II: Siege Pack remains a benchmark for how expansion packs should be designed—adding substantial content, new gameplay modes, and creative tools while maintaining what made the original game successful.
