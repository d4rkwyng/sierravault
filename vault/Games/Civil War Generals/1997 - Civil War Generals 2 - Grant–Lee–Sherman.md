# Civil War Generals 2: Grant, Lee, Sherman

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 30, 2026</small>

## Overview

Civil War Generals 2: Grant, Lee, Sherman represents the pinnacle of historical strategy gaming from the mid-1990s, building upon the foundation established by its acclaimed predecessor Robert E. Lee: Civil War General[^ref-1]. Originally released in 1997 by Sierra Entertainment[^ref-2], this ambitious sequel expanded the scope beyond Confederate General Lee to encompass the full breadth of Civil War leadership, allowing players to command forces under legendary generals from both sides of the conflict[^ref-3]. As one gaming enthusiast noted, "Civil War Generals 2 has been the best Civil War game I could fine as most focus on WWII or other wars"[^ref-4].

The game emerged during a golden age of historical wargaming, when Sierra On-Line was undergoing significant corporate changes under its acquisition by CUC International[^ref-5]. Despite these business upheavals, the development team, led by designers Charles Moylan, Jeffrey Fiske, and Steve Grammont[^ref-6], created what would become "a serious wargame, wrapped in a friendly multimedia package"[^ref-7]. The game's innovative WeGo turn-based system represented a significant advancement in strategy gaming mechanics, where players issue orders simultaneously and then watch a 60-second simulation unfold[^ref-8].

## Story Summary

Civil War Generals 2 places players at the heart of America's defining conflict, offering unprecedented control over the campaigns that shaped the nation's destiny. Unlike its predecessor which focused exclusively on Robert E. Lee's Confederate perspective, this sequel allows command of both Union and Confederate forces across multiple theaters of war[^ref-13]. The game spans the entire conflict from 1861 to 1865, featuring over 200 predesigned scenarios and 17 total campaigns that recreate the strategic challenges faced by history's greatest military minds[^ref-14].

Players can experience pivotal battles including First and Second Battle of Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, and The Wilderness[^ref-15]. The designers took creative liberties with historical accuracy when necessary, noting that "even though Lee was not present during the First Battle of Bull Run, the designers included this significant battle because of it's importance"[^ref-16]. For players who exceed the performance of their historical counterparts, the game offers a tantalizing fictional scenario: "If you do better than Bobby Lee himself, you also get to tackle a fantasy battle in and around Washington D.C."[^ref-17]

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The game employs an intuitive top-down perspective with detailed tactical maps featuring interlocking squares that represent terrain cover and elevation[^ref-18]. Players control their forces using a point-based movement system similar to X-Com: Enemy Unknown, where "you take the role of General Lee and issue commands to your army factions of infantry, cavalry, artillery and specialists"[^ref-19]. The interface supports both keyboard and mouse input across 13 different terrain types[^ref-20], allowing for precise tactical maneuvering across historically accurate battlefields.

Combat resolution follows the innovative WeGo system, a custom 3D game engine where both players issue orders simultaneously before watching a 60-second battle simulation[^ref-21]. This approach eliminates the traditional turn-based advantage of moving second while maintaining strategic depth. The system operates on brigade-level units across 200-yard hexes with half-hour turns[^ref-22], providing an authentic command experience that balances historical accuracy with engaging gameplay mechanics.

### Structure and Progression

Civil War Generals 2 offers multiple gameplay modes, including single-player campaigns, multiplayer options via modem, serial, IPX, hot-seat, and play-by-email[^ref-23]. The difficulty scales significantly across three levels, where "on the hardest level, the typical 'charge the guns, boys!' approach will lead to horrendous casualties among your troops"[^ref-24]. Players must carefully manage resources, terrain advantages, and unit positioning while adapting to dynamic battlefield conditions.

The game includes special mechanics for unlocking historical figures, particularly Robert E. Lee, who "is locked in the game until certain conditions are met"[^ref-25]. Lee can unlock between Early March '62 and Early June '62, with a 10% chance monthly until automatically unlocking by Early June regardless of conditions[^ref-26]. This mechanic adds strategic depth to campaign progression, requiring players to balance historical authenticity with gameplay objectives.

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The core strategic challenge revolves around combined arms tactics, where players must coordinate infantry, cavalry, artillery, and specialist units across varied terrain[^ref-27]. The game rewards historical understanding of Civil War tactics while punishing players who employ anachronistic strategies. Environmental factors play crucial roles, with weather, terrain, and supply lines affecting unit performance and movement capabilities.

Advanced players discovered extensive modding capabilities, allowing customization of character unlock events by editing game files[^ref-28]. One community expert explained that players can "change the date to when you want him to show up. Also, change the FixType = 999 to a value of 0"[^ref-29] to modify Lee's availability. This modding support extended the game's longevity and created an active community of historical enthusiasts who created custom scenarios and campaigns.

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| GameSpot | 6.7/10 | "Extensive scenarios for wargame enthusiasts"[^ref-30] |
| PC Gamer | 84% | "Think of it as the Panzer General of Civil War games"[^ref-31] |
| MyAbandonware | 4.28/5 | Community rating based on historical accuracy[^ref-32] |
| ESRB | E-Everyone | Suitable for all ages[^ref-33] |

Professional critics praised the game's ambitious scope and technical innovations. GameSpot's Michael E. concluded that "if you're a wargame or Civil War enthusiast looking for an extensive list of scenarios to keep you occupied for a while, this is definitely the game for you"[^ref-34]. PC Gamer awarded the game 84% and ranked it among significant historical strategy titles[^ref-35], while noting its accessibility to newcomers despite complex underlying mechanics.

### Modern Assessment

Contemporary players on preservation sites like MyAbandonware continue to praise the game's educational value and strategic depth. User "John B Gordon" noted that while "the AI was terrible. When I wasn't playing online I would play against myself," the multiplayer experience was exceptional, claiming to be "very good at it; nickname was Gordo; very seldom lost"[^ref-36]. Another user, "The General's Daughter," emphasized that "this game is a valuable teaching tool, and full of history"[^ref-37].

The game's legacy extends beyond entertainment, with players appreciating its balanced approach to controversial historical material. User "Taps" defended the game's educational merit, explaining it covers "historical battles and Generals.. ect. No politics, no metion of slavery and you can play for the north or south"[^ref-38]. This neutral stance allowed the game to serve as an accessible introduction to Civil War military history without becoming mired in political debates.

## Development

### Origins

Civil War Generals 2 emerged from the success of Robert E. Lee: Civil War General, which had become the best-selling wargame of 1996[^ref-39]. The original game was developed by Impressions Games and published by Sierra On-Line, establishing a template for accessible historical strategy gaming[^ref-40]. Designer Jeffrey Fiske's philosophy was to "create a product that Civil War enthusiasts could play, regardless of prior gaming experience"[^ref-41], a vision that directly influenced the sequel's expanded scope and improved user interface.

Development occurred during a turbulent period for Sierra On-Line, as the company was acquired by CUC International in a deal worth over $700 million[^ref-42]. Company president Ken Williams viewed this as "an opportunity for Sierra to capitalize on what we already do extremely well: develop the highest-quality interactive entertainment, education and productivity titles in the industry"[^ref-43]. Despite corporate upheaval, Sierra president Mike Brochu assured stakeholders that the acquisition would have "little, if any, effect on the operations of Sierra"[^ref-44].

### Production

The development team consisted primarily of Steve Grammont and Charles Moylan, who formed Battlefront.com after their work on Civil War strategy games[^ref-45]. Grammont later reflected on their development philosophy: "We both like beer. Good beer"[^ref-46], describing the informal partnership that led to innovative game design. Their approach emphasized historical authenticity combined with accessible gameplay mechanics, drawing inspiration from successful titles like Panzer General[^ref-47].

The game featured music composed by Jason P. Rinaldi, Keith Zizza, and Steven Serafino[^ref-48], creating an atmospheric soundtrack that enhanced the historical immersion. Audio elements were crucial to the Civil War experience, reflecting the historical reality that Confederate General Robert E. Lee believed "I don't think we could have an army without music"[^ref-49]. This attention to period authenticity extended to visual elements, including artwork by Civil War artist Mort Künstler[^ref-50].

### Technical Achievements

Civil War Generals 2 pushed the boundaries of mid-1990s gaming technology with its custom 3D engine and innovative WeGo turn-based system[^ref-51]. The game required minimum specifications of a 486DX33 processor, 8MB RAM, and Windows 3.1 or higher, with a double-speed CD-ROM drive[^ref-52]. Enhanced versions supported Super VGA graphics and sound cards for improved audiovisual experience[^ref-53].

The development process involved extensive historical research and technical innovation. Steve Grammont described their resourceful approach: "We had no idea if the pictures were going to come out well"[^ref-54] when discussing their method of photographing model tanks for game assets. The team's dedication to authenticity required rare out-of-print books and careful attention to historical detail, resulting in a product that satisfied both gaming and educational markets.

## Legacy

Civil War Generals 2 established a lasting impact on historical strategy gaming, particularly in its approach to making complex wargames accessible to mainstream audiences. The development team's success led to recognition within the industry, with PC Gamer eventually ranking related titles among the top 35 all-time great PC games[^ref-55]. Steve Grammont's reflection on their achievement was characteristically modest: "We made a kick-ass game. ... It wound up selling a lot. A lot more than they thought it would"[^ref-56].

The game's educational value extended beyond entertainment, serving as a bridge between academic Civil War history and popular culture. Its balanced treatment of controversial historical topics allowed educators to use it as a teaching tool while avoiding political sensitivities. The inclusion of detailed historical documentation and reenactment footage preserved important cultural material, with some content later archived by institutions like the Internet Archive[^ref-57].

NPD retail tracking data from September 1996 showed strong commercial performance, with the original Robert E. Lee: Civil War General ranking #8 in the reference software category at a $51 price point across 8,823 stores[^ref-58]. This commercial success validated the market demand for sophisticated historical gaming experiences and paved the way for future educational strategy titles.
