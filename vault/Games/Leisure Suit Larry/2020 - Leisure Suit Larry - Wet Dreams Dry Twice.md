<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

Leisure Suit Larry: Wet Dreams Dry Twice is a 2020 point-and-click adventure game developed by German studio CrazyBunch and published by Assemble Entertainment[^ref-34]. As the direct sequel to 2018's Leisure Suit Larry: Wet Dreams Don't Dry, the game continues Larry Laffer's modern adventures as he searches for his true love Faith across the mysterious Kalau'a archipelago[^ref-10]. The game represents the tenth installment in the long-running Leisure Suit Larry series and serves as the conclusion to the "Wet Dreams" saga[^ref-53].

The game initially launched for PC on October 23, 2020, after being delayed from its original October 15 release date[^ref-37]. Console versions for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch followed on May 18, 2021[^ref-18], with mobile versions for iOS and Android arriving in 2022[^ref-40]. Notable for being Jan Rabson's final performance as Larry Laffer before his death in October 2022, the game features over 50 hand-drawn locations and more than 40 characters[^ref-11].

## Story Summary

The game picks up directly where Wet Dreams Don't Dry concluded, with Larry Laffer having lost track of his beloved Faith and finding himself stranded in the tropical location of Cancún[^ref-17]. Larry must explore the mysterious Kalau'a archipelago to reunite with Faith, whom he was prepared to marry at the end of the previous game[^ref-17]. The story takes Larry through various island locations as he encounters both new characters and familiar faces from the previous installment[^ref-53].

Set against the backdrop of a tropical paradise, Larry's quest involves solving puzzles, helping island inhabitants, and navigating the complex social dynamics of the archipelago[^ref-25]. The narrative maintains the series' trademark blend of romantic comedy and sexual innuendo while updating the humor for contemporary audiences[^ref-3]. As described by one reviewer, Larry is portrayed as "a likeable protagonist ripped directly from the eighties" who "has a lot to learn about modern sensibilities"[^ref-15].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Leisure Suit Larry: Wet Dreams Dry Twice features what one reviewer called "the pinnacle of point and click adventure game user interface"[^ref-48]. The game utilizes a modern point-and-click control scheme with left and right mouse actions, mouse wheel navigation for inventory and Larry's PiPhone, and spacebar or middle mouse button to highlight interactive objects[^ref-34]. The interface can accommodate both traditional mouse and keyboard controls as well as gamepad input[^ref-34].

The game's inventory system centers around Larry's smartphone, called the PiPhone, which serves multiple functions including storing items and providing in-game hints[^ref-48]. Players can navigate through the game's numerous locations using a streamlined interface that eliminates much of the traditional "pixel hunting" associated with classic adventure games[^ref-3].

### Structure and Progression

The game features over 50 beautifully hand-drawn locations spread across the Kalau'a archipelago[^ref-17]. Players progress through the story linearly while having the freedom to explore available areas and interact with over 40 characters[^ref-34]. The game includes various mini-games, including a Flappy Bird parody that can be skipped for players who prefer to focus on the main adventure[^ref-53].

One unique aspect noted by players is that the game requires two complete playthroughs to achieve 100% completion, as certain achievements are mutually exclusive and depend on Larry wearing either his leisure suit or wedding suit throughout the entire game[^ref-38]. The choice must be made within the first 20 minutes and affects the entire playthrough[^ref-38].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The puzzle design in Wet Dreams Dry Twice has been praised for avoiding excessive "moon logic" - the adventure game trope of having solutions that make little logical sense[^ref-20]. As one reviewer noted, "There is very little 'moon logic' in this game"[^ref-20]. The puzzles generally follow logical patterns while maintaining the humorous tone expected from the series[^ref-3].

The game includes various interactive elements and inventory-based puzzles typical of point-and-click adventures[^ref-48]. Some puzzles incorporate elements of random chance, making them slightly more challenging than traditional adventure game fare[^ref-39]. Players can expect to complete the game in approximately 8-10 hours depending on their familiarity with adventure games[^ref-48].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Leisure Suit Larry: Wet Dreams Dry Twice received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with aggregate scores reflecting the polarizing nature of the series' humor and content.

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Adventure Gamers | 4.5/5 stars | "Superb game that excels in just about every area"[^ref-3] |
| Metacritic (PC) | 73/100 | Professional critic average[^ref-27] |
| Metacritic (Switch) | 78/100 | Console version received slightly higher scores[^ref-28] |
| OpenCritic | 67/100 | 45% Critics Recommend[^ref-36] |
| TechRaptor | 6.5/10 | Mixed review citing gameplay strengths but humor weaknesses[^ref-47] |
| Push Square | 6/10 | Noted control issues and accessibility problems[^ref-41] |
| Steam Users | 83% positive | Based on 695 user reviews[^ref-45] |

The game received particular praise from Ragequit.gr, which awarded it 91/100 and called it "One of the best point 'n' click adventures of recent years"[^ref-27]. Adventure Gamers gave it their highest rating, stating it was "a worthy continuation of Sierra's classic Leisure Suit Larry games"[^ref-27].

### Modern Assessment

User reviews and retrospective assessments have generally been more positive than initial critical reception. Steam users maintain an 83% positive rating[^ref-45], and trophy hunting communities have provided detailed analyses of the game's structure and requirements[^ref-38]. One Reddit user described it as having "surprisingly good" production values with "overall good voice acting, some nice music and nicely drawn 2d graphics"[^ref-42].

The game received recognition from Thumb Culture, which awarded it a "Gold Award" and praised its story structure: "The story builds up beautifully and keeps you engaged throughout your exploration and puzzle-solving, leading to a very satisfying climax"[^ref-49]. However, some players criticized technical issues, with loading times being described as "atrocious" by some users[^ref-14].

## Development

### Origins

Leisure Suit Larry: Wet Dreams Dry Twice was developed by CrazyBunch, a German independent studio that had previously revived the Leisure Suit Larry franchise with 2018's Wet Dreams Don't Dry[^ref-34]. The development team made a conscious decision not to include original series creator Al Lowe in the development process, despite Lowe indicating he would be willing to provide assistance if asked[^ref-26].

The project was based on an original idea by Stefan Marcinek and received funding support from the Creative Europe Media Programme of the European Union[^ref-34]. As Assemble Entertainment CEO Stefan Marcinek stated, "Bringing Larry Laffer back to his adoring fans has been a labor of love and something that we've not taken lightly"[^ref-7].

### Production

The game's voice cast was led by Jan Rabson reprising his role as Larry Laffer, a character he had voiced since Leisure Suit Larry 6 in 1993[^ref-3]. This would prove to be Rabson's final performance in the role before his death in October 2022[^ref-11]. The supporting cast included Charlotte Moore as Faith, Melli Bond as Nari, and several other voice actors bringing the game's diverse cast of characters to life[^ref-22].

Music was composed by Kai Rosenkranz and Tilo Alpermann, creating a 41-track soundtrack that spans 1 hour and 11 minutes[^ref-8]. The soundtrack was well-received by players, with one user commenting, "the soundtrack was surprisingly good"[^ref-8]. Additional design work was provided by Tiny Roar UG, with sound production by Double Shot Audio and voice recording by Outsource Media Ltd. and toneworx GmbH[^ref-34].

### Technical Achievements

Built using the Unity engine, Wet Dreams Dry Twice features hand-drawn 2D artwork with what one reviewer described as "impressive hi-res artwork incorporating an equally impressive amount of phallic symbols wherever you look"[^ref-49]. The game's technical specifications require Windows Vista/7/8/10, a 2.33GHz processor, 2GB RAM, and 4GB of available storage space[^ref-34].

The game supports eight languages including English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Polish, and Russian[^ref-34]. Despite being developed on an indie budget, the production values were generally praised, though some technical issues were noted including occasional crashes that prompted guide writers to recommend frequent manual saves[^ref-38].

## Legacy

Leisure Suit Larry: Wet Dreams Dry Twice serves as both the conclusion to the "Wet Dreams" saga and potentially the final game in the entire Leisure Suit Larry franchise[^ref-53]. According to IMDb trivia, "due to low sales of this game, the decision was made not to proceed with the idea" of continuing the series[^ref-26]. This makes it a significant entry as the possible final chapter in Larry Laffer's adventures.

The game's impact extends beyond its narrative conclusion, representing a successful revival of the point-and-click adventure genre during a period when such games had limited commercial appeal[^ref-61]. As one reviewer noted, "In a world where the point-and-click genre has passed its heyday, this notorious series is one of the few keeping it going"[^ref-61].

The game also holds historical significance as Jan Rabson's final portrayal of Larry Laffer, ending nearly three decades of voice work on the character[^ref-11]. The game's charitable initiative, where each purchase of the "Save the World Edition" provided two meals for hungry children through a partnership with ShareTheMeal, demonstrated how modern game releases could incorporate social responsibility[^ref-40].
