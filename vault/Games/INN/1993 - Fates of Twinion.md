<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 7, 2026</small>

## Overview

Fates of Twinion is a fantasy RPG dungeon crawler developed by [[Sierra On-Line]] and released in 1993.[^ref-1] Originally designed as an online multiplayer game for The Sierra Network (later renamed ImagiNation Network), the game served as a successor to [[1991 - The Shadow of Yserbius|The Shadow of Yserbius]].[^ref-2] The game was part of Sierra's pioneering early foray into online gaming, featuring up to 30-60 players in a graphical MUD environment with groups of up to 4 players.[^ref-3]

The game was "intended not for authentic offline play but to whet the player's appetite for an online account."[^ref-4] When The Sierra Network closed, Fates of Twinion lost its multiplayer functionality and was distributed as a single-player experience.[^ref-5] Computer Gaming World recognized the game as a finalist for Online Game of the Year in June 1994.[^ref-2]

Sierra tried to create "a more complex game with a wider range of puzzles, traps, and turns" compared to its predecessor[^ref-6], getting "more story and diversity out of the original game engine."[^ref-7]

## Story Summary

The game's narrative centers around the realm of Twinion, where "once again brave warriors and wizards are needed to enter dangerous dungeons and uncover the secrets of the evils that plague the land."[^ref-3] Players must prove themselves worthy of being "Heroes who will solve the numerous quests and step through to Immortality."[^ref-9] The main quest involves finding four pieces of a map to challenge mighty beasts called Dralkarians.[^ref-10]

The player receives guidance through cryptic messages like "Find your fate in the portal east of here"[^ref-11] and must navigate complex dungeons filled with wraiths, illusions, golems, and vampire sorceresses.[^ref-10]

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Fates of Twinion features a first-person 3D perspective with keyboard and mouse controls.[^ref-3] The game uses the same engine as The Shadow of Yserbius, with many graphics reused between the games.[^ref-12] Players navigate through castle floors, dungeons, and various locations while managing their character's progression and inventory.

The game includes an auto-map feature and character portrait editor.[^ref-10] Grid-based movement and turn-based combat define the core interaction system.[^ref-13]

- Teleportation systems between areas[^ref-15]
- Death serving as a travel mechanism to the top of the mountain rather than a traditional penalty[^ref-15]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Computer Gaming World | Finalist | Online Game of the Year, June 1994[^ref-2] |
| MobyGames Critics | 61% | User ratings[^ref-18] |
| MobyGames Players | 4.7/5 | Alternative rating scale[^ref-19] |
| MyAbandonware | 4.19/5 | Reviewed by HOTUD[^ref-14] |

| Emuparadise | 4/5 | User rating[^ref-20] |

### Critical Assessment

Computer Gaming World noted that "Playing Yserbius without fellow on-line gamers is like being in an amusement park after hours, on in which the rides aren't all that fun to begin with."[^ref-2]

The CRPG Addict described it as "a competent enough dungeon crawler, not terribly far from Wizardry or The Bard's Tale in quality, except for the baffling decision not to allow the single player to create a full party."[^ref-4] However, they also noted it "feels like an empty, unfinished, single-player Wizardry."[^ref-4]

Their detailed critique elaborated: "Twinion offers too much breadth—too large a physical space—without enough depth or immersion. It's a line rather than a cube. The online version of Twinion must have at least been a square. Multiplayer interaction and the increase in combat tactics would have created greater depth."[^ref-21]

### Modern Assessment

Modern reviewers have been more positive about the game's qualities as a dungeon crawler. HOTUD recommended it as "highly recommended for RPG beginners" and described it as having "solid 'dungeon crawls' that are definitely better than average."[^ref-14]

ClassicReload noted that "stripped off its multiplayer features, they are still decent RPGs, with a good variety of monsters, spells, interesting sub-quests."[^ref-5]

The speedrunning community maintains interest, with one player noting that "Yserbius (in the Medievalands engine) can be beaten in under two hours from new characters."[^ref-22]

## Development

### Origins

Fates of Twinion was developed as part of Sierra's ambitious early online gaming initiative through The Sierra Network.[^ref-2] The game was designed to build upon the success of The Shadow of Yserbius, serving as its direct successor.[^ref-2] Sierra tried to get more story and diversity out of the original game engine.[^ref-7]

### Production Challenges

The development was troubled, with designer Richard Aronson later revealing that "Fates of Twinion was so buggy QA refused to test anymore."[^ref-6] Brian Thomson noted the technical challenges of early online gaming: "Ken [Williams] had no idea at the how hardcore gamers would eat his bandwidth."[^ref-6]

The extensive development team included designers Fred Butts, Joe Ybarra, Mark Dickenson, Michael Moore, Scot Amos, Sharon Chercowy, and Wendy Barlow.[^ref-8] Russell Lieblich composed the music.[^ref-8]
