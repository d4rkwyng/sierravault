# Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress is a fantasy role-playing game designed and programmed by Richard Garriott, released on August 24, 1982.[^ref-1] The game stands as the only official Ultima title ever published by Sierra On-Line, making it a unique entry in both the Ultima series and Sierra's catalog.[^ref-1] Taking place across multiple time periods on Earth rather than the fantasy world of Britannia, the game features an ambitious time-travel premise inspired by the 1981 Terry Gilliam film Time Bandits.[^ref-1][^ref-2]

The game marked several significant firsts for the Ultima franchise: it was the first game in the series to include a cloth map as part of its packaging,[^ref-1] the first Ultima game Garriott wrote completely in assembly language,[^ref-1] and the first original Ultima release to appear on more than one system simultaneously.[^ref-3][^ref-6] The game has been classified as a role-playing game in the RPG genre databases.[^ref-8] Development took almost two years while Garriott attended the University of Texas, during which time he learned assembly language in just one month from programmer Tom Luhrs.[^ref-1]

Despite mixed reception regarding its gameplay balance, Ultima II was commercially successful enough that Garriott was able to found his own company, Origin Systems, shortly after its release.[^ref-3] Contemporary reviews praised the game's ambitious scope and technical achievements, with Softline describing it as a title that "continues the interplanetary saga with a creative programming flair far beyond the scope of most fantasy or adventure games."[^ref-1]

## Story Summary

The game takes place after the events of Ultima I, in which the hero defeated the evil wizard Mondain. However, Mondain had an apprentice and lover named Minax, a powerful enchantress who seeks revenge for her master's death.[^ref-1] Minax has manipulated time itself, creating temporal distortions that threaten to unravel reality across all of Earth's history.[^ref-1]

Unlike other Ultima games set in the fantasy realm of Britannia, Ultima II unfolds entirely on Earth across different time periods.[^ref-4] The player must navigate through various eras of human history, utilizing time doors that allow passage between different epochs.[^ref-3] The map and time-travel mechanics were directly inspired by the film Time Bandits, with Garriott reportedly going to see the movie repeatedly just to copy down the map seen in the film and incorporate it into his game.[^ref-2]

The quest culminates in a confrontation with Minax, who can only be defeated using a special weapon called the Quicksword Enilno. When spelled backward, "Enilno" becomes "Online," a clever reference to the game's publisher, Sierra On-Line.[^ref-2] In the map of the solar system, Earth is notably located at coordinates (6,6,6), adding a subtle ominous touch to the world design.[^ref-2]

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Ultima II utilizes a keyboard-driven interface with single-key commands for various actions.[^ref-5] The game presents the world through a top-down tile-based perspective, with the player character navigating through overworld maps, dungeons, and eventually space.[^ref-2] Input is handled entirely through keyboard commands, following the conventions established in the original Ultima.[^ref-2]

### Structure and Progression

The game is structured around exploration across multiple time periods on Earth and eventually space travel to other planets in the solar system.[^ref-1] Players must gather equipment, increase their statistics, and accumulate resources to prepare for the final confrontation with Minax.[^ref-4]

- **Time Travel:** Navigation through various historical eras via time doors[^ref-3]
- **Earth Exploration:** Multiple continents and regions across different time periods[^ref-1]
- **Space Travel:** Interplanetary exploration of the solar system[^ref-2]
- **Dungeon Crawling:** First-person dungeon exploration segments[^ref-2]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The gameplay heavily emphasizes resource management and character development, requiring extensive gold accumulation to purchase necessary items and services.[^ref-4] Everything in the game requires gold, making it an extremely grindy experience by modern standards.[^ref-4] One reviewer described it as "essentially a non-stop grindfest of frustrating proportions."[^ref-4]

A notable bug prevents the Strength statistic from increasing after character creation, which can significantly impact gameplay progression.[^ref-3] Additionally, the HP counter can experience rollover issues that could instantly kill the player character under certain conditions.[^ref-3]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Ultima II received generally positive reviews upon release, though opinions varied on specific aspects of the gameplay experience. Softline magazine in January 1983 "highly praised" the game "for its fast-paced gameplay, quality graphics, and realistic worlds."[^ref-3] The publication declared that "Lord British has another, greater hit on his hands ... the ultimate in real-time D&D type fantasy games for the micro."[^ref-1]

Computer Gaming World provided a positive review in 1983, recognizing the game's ambitious scope and technical achievements.[^ref-1] K-Power magazine awarded the game 7 out of 10,[^ref-1] while PC Magazine gave it an impressive 15.5 out of 18 points.[^ref-1]

Troy Christensen of Different Worlds magazine proclaimed that "Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress is a classic fantasy computer adventure game that is a must for anyone serious in computer gaming."[^ref-1] The game was nominated for "Best Adventure Game for Home Computer" at the 1983 Origins Game Fair, though it lost to Wizardry II: The Knight of Diamonds.[^ref-1]

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospective reviews have been more mixed, with many critics identifying Ultima II as the weakest entry in the Ultima series.[^ref-4][^ref-9] MobyGames user Salim Farhat characterized it as "more like Time Bandit fanfiction than Ultima," noting that "the game wasn't so much Ultima as it was Time Bandits with a twist."[^ref-2] Daniel Saner wrote that "at most times, Ultima II more resembles work than play."[^ref-2]

The GOG.com release of the Ultima 1+2+3 compilation maintains a 4 out of 5 user rating based on 55 reviews,[^ref-4] though reviewers consistently single out Ultima II as the collection's weak link. One reviewer noted that the "graphics [are] particularly hard to look at in Ultima II."[^ref-4]

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** 7.6/10[^ref-2]
- **GOG.com:** 4/5 (55 reviews, for trilogy compilation)[^ref-4]
- **GameFAQs:** 3.3/5[^ref-7]

## Development

### Origins

The development of Ultima II began while Richard Garriott was attending the University of Texas.[^ref-1] After the success of Ultima I, Garriott sought a publisher who would agree to include a cloth map with the game packaging—a feature that had become important to him for immersion purposes.[^ref-3] Sierra On-Line was the only company willing to include the cloth map, leading to their selection as publisher.[^ref-3]

Garriott was heavily influenced by the 1981 film Time Bandits during development, attending multiple screenings specifically to document and recreate the map featured in the film.[^ref-2] This inspiration manifested in the game's time-travel mechanics and the design of its time doors.[^ref-1][^ref-3]

### Production

Development took almost two years, a significant undertaking for a solo developer.[^ref-1] A crucial milestone was Garriott learning assembly language in just one month from Tom Luhrs, allowing him to write the entire game in assembly rather than BASIC.[^ref-1] This was the first Ultima game Garriott wrote completely in assembly language, representing a significant technical advancement over its predecessor.[^ref-1]

Richard Garriott made Ultima I through III almost completely single-handedly, with the original Akalabeth having been programmed on a computer in his high school.[^ref-2] This independent development approach continued with Ultima II, establishing Garriott's reputation as a singular creative force in the RPG genre.

**Development Credits:**[^ref-1][^ref-2][^ref-13]
- **Designer/Programmer:** Richard Garriott
- **Assembly Language Mentor:** Tom Luhrs
- **Atari Version:** Chuckles (Charles Bueche)
- **Documentation:** Mary Taylor Rollo

### Technical Achievements

Ultima II was notable for being one of the first graphical games ported to the Atari ST platform.[^ref-3] The game pushed the technical capabilities of multiple computer systems simultaneously, as Origin Systems (and before them, Sierra On-Line) was "infamous for pushing computer systems to the limit."[^ref-4]

The IBM PC version was specifically designed to be played on an IBM CGA system with a composite color monitor, which produced different color output than the standard RGB display.[^ref-2] The game was programmed entirely in assembly language, allowing for improved performance compared to interpreted BASIC programs.[^ref-1]

### Cut Content

While no specific cut content has been documented, the game as released contained many areas that were "simply empty" and some planets that had "literally nothing on them."[^ref-3] This suggests that time or resource constraints may have prevented the full realization of Garriott's vision for the game's scope.

### Technical Issues

The IBM PC version of Ultima II is notorious for being prone to divide by zero errors and crashing.[^ref-1] The game runs too fast on modern computers since it was designed for the original IBM PC's 4.77 MHz CPU clock speed, making it unplayable without slowdown measures.[^ref-1][^ref-5]

A critical issue affects later DOS releases and re-releases: when files from all the game's disks were copied to one folder, several files with identical file names were overwritten.[^ref-2] This eventually eliminated all the outer-space game maps, rendering space travel useless and the game unwinnable without applying a fan patch.[^ref-2]

Additional documented bugs include:[^ref-3][^ref-4][^ref-5]
- Bug preventing Strength stat increase after character creation[^ref-3]
- HP counter rollover that could instantly kill the character[^ref-3]
- Blank disk error when creating new character in GOG version (fixed in 2025)[^ref-4]
- PLAYER save cannot be overwritten in-game[^ref-5]
- Game crashes when saving with GOG version unless PLAYER.U2 directory is created[^ref-5]
- Planetary maps appearing as Earth maps in Ultima I-VI Series compilations[^ref-3]

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- **Enilno Sword:** The weapon needed to defeat the villain is a sword called Enilno. Spelled backward, it becomes "Online"—a reference to Sierra On-Line, the game's publisher.[^ref-2]
- **Earth Coordinates:** In the map of the solar system, Earth is located at coordinates (6,6,6).[^ref-2]
- **Time Bandits Inspiration:** The time doors and overall map design were directly inspired by the 1981 film Time Bandits, with Garriott attending multiple screenings to copy down the map.[^ref-1][^ref-2]
- **Cloth Map First:** This was the first game in the Ultima series to include a cloth map, a feature that became a beloved tradition.[^ref-1][^ref-14]
- **Cover Art:** Ultima II is the only installment in the series not to feature a cover painting by Denis Loubet. The dragon in the title screen was taken from the Ultima I cover.[^ref-3]
- **Pop Culture References:** The game contains numerous pop-culture references throughout.[^ref-3]
- **Celebrity Influence:** South Park co-creator Trey Parker has cited Ultima II as an early RPG influence on his work.[^ref-3]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Ultima II achieved significant commercial success, selling over 50,000 copies by November 1985 and approaching nearly 100,000 copies by 1990.[^ref-1] These sales figures were substantial enough that Richard Garriott was able to found his own company, Origin Systems, shortly after the game's release.[^ref-3]

The relationship between Garriott and Sierra On-Line deteriorated after the game's release, leading to difficulties when Origin Systems wanted to re-release the title.[^ref-3][^ref-12] Sierra refused to sell the rights to Origin for many years and didn't relinquish the original cover artwork until 1998.[^ref-3] There are two DOS ports of Revenge of the Enchantress; the second, released on the various Ultima collections, removes all mention of Sierra On-Line from the title.[^ref-12]

### Collections

Ultima II has been included in several compilation releases:

- **Ultima Trilogy I-II-III** (1989) – Included an enhanced version with audiovisual upgrades, exclusively available in this box set[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- **Ultima 1+2+3** – GOG.com digital release (2011-present)[^ref-4]

The 1989 enhanced version for Apple II is extremely rare due to its exclusive anthology availability.[^ref-3]

### Fan Projects

Due to the critical bug in re-releases that eliminated planetary map files, fan patches became necessary to make later versions of the game completable.[^ref-2] The community has worked to preserve and restore the original gameplay experience that was compromised in official re-releases.

### Related Publications

- **Cloth Map:** Included with original game release, inspired by Time Bandits film[^ref-1]
- **Game Manual:** Standard documentation included with retail release[^ref-1]
- **The Official Book of Ultima:** Strategy guide covering the Ultima series[^ref-11]

### Critical Perspective

Ultima II occupies a curious position in RPG history as both a significant technical achievement and a somewhat divisive gameplay experience. The game represents the Ultima series at a transitional moment—ambitious in scope but rough in execution. Its time-travel premise across Earth's history rather than the fantasy world of Britannia distinguishes it from other entries in the series, making it feel less like a true Ultima game to many players.[^ref-2]

The game's historical significance lies in several areas: it demonstrated that RPGs could feature complex temporal mechanics and multi-era storytelling; it established the cloth map as a beloved tradition in premium game packaging; and its commercial success enabled Richard Garriott to establish Origin Systems, which would go on to create some of the most influential RPGs ever made.[^ref-1][^ref-3] However, its reputation as the weakest entry in the series has persisted,[^ref-4] with the extremely grindy gameplay and numerous bugs overshadowing its innovative elements. The game is perhaps best understood as an essential stepping stone—both technically and commercially—that made the greater achievements of later Ultima titles possible.
