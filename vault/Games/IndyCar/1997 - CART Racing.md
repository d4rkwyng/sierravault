## Overview

CART Racing is a 1997 re-release of IndyCar Racing II, developed by [[Papyrus Design Group]] and published by [[Sierra On-Line]][^ref-1]. The game simulates the 1995 season of the IndyCar World Series with realistic car handling and competitive racing, featuring 15 tracks and a selection of chassis and engines[^ref-2]. Originally released as IndyCar Racing II in 1996, the title was rebranded following a dispute between Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) and Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony George over control of the racing series, which led to CART losing the rights to the "IndyCar" name[^ref-3].

The re-release brought significant technical improvements, including Windows 95 compatibility and Rendition 3D acceleration support, making the simulation more accessible to players with newer hardware[^ref-1]. Papyrus, co-founded by [[Dave Kaemmer]]—arguably the father of modern racing simulation—had established itself as the premier developer of realistic racing games, with professional drivers often using their software to train for real-life races[^ref-4]. CART Racing continued this tradition, offering what many considered "one of the best racing simulators ever released"[^ref-2].

The game earned recognition as a serious simulation, with Computer Gaming World naming it Sports Game of the Year alongside Baseball Mogul in their March 1998 issue[^ref-3]. Despite the acclaim, the title struggled commercially partly because it was often bundled with 3D cards rather than sold independently[^ref-3].

## Story Summary

As a racing simulation, CART Racing does not feature a traditional narrative storyline. Instead, players assume the role of an open-wheel racing driver competing in the 1995 CART FedEx Championship Series[^ref-2]. The game presents the authentic challenge of professional motorsport, where players must prove themselves across fifteen demanding circuits ranging from high-speed ovals to technical road courses.

The career mode allows players to experience the progression of a racing season, competing against AI opponents who represent the real drivers and teams of the 1995 season. Success requires mastering both the technical aspects of car setup and the physical demands of piloting vehicles capable of reaching speeds up to 220 mph[^ref-7]. The ultimate goal is to accumulate enough points throughout the season to claim the CART Championship.

The simulation captures the essence of what David Kaemmer originally envisioned when founding Papyrus: "I wanted to make a program that would show someone, as much as possible, what it was like to drive a racecar"[^ref-4]. This philosophy permeates every aspect of the game, creating an experience that prioritizes authenticity over arcade-style accessibility.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

CART Racing offers multiple control schemes to accommodate different play styles and hardware configurations. Players can use keyboard controls, mouse input, or dedicated racing wheels for the most authentic experience[^ref-3]. The game features comprehensive view options, including an immersive cockpit perspective that places players directly behind the steering wheel with a great level of confidence and assurance[^ref-8].

The interface includes detailed telemetry displays showing crucial information such as speed, RPM, tire temperatures, and lap times. GameSpot noted that "even on the easiest of settings, driving an IndyCar is comparable to riding a wild bull," highlighting the simulation's steep learning curve[^ref-5].

### Structure and Progression

The game is structured around the authentic 1995 CART season, featuring fifteen real-world circuits[^ref-9]:

- **Road Courses:** Laguna Seca, Road America (Elkhart Lake), Mid-Ohio, and others
- **Street Circuits:** Urban tracks with challenging barriers and elevation changes
- **Oval Tracks:** High-speed superspeedways requiring different driving techniques

Players can engage in single races, full championship seasons, or practice sessions to hone their skills. The championship mode tracks points accumulated across all fifteen events, mirroring the real series format.

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The primary "puzzle" in CART Racing lies in mastering vehicle setup and racing strategy. The game offers thirteen different customizable characteristics for each car, allowing players to adjust parameters including[^ref-5]:

- Tire compounds and pressures
- Aerodynamic settings (front and rear wings)
- Suspension geometry
- Gear ratios
- Fuel loads

GameRevolution observed that "you could spend an entire week inside the garage just fiddling with the many ways to improve your car's performance"[^ref-5]. The enhanced artificial intelligence system ensures that opponents' cars respond more realistically, with "an infinite number of behaviors based on your driving reactions"[^ref-10].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

CART Racing and its parent title IndyCar Racing II received strong critical acclaim upon release. GameSpot awarded the game 7.8 out of 10[^ref-5], while Computer Games Magazine gave it 4 out of 5 stars[^ref-5]. PC Games awarded a B grade, with reviewer Bill Meyer praising the simulation in the December 1995 issue[^ref-5].

Computer Gaming World's editors noted that the game "takes the already excellent IndyCar design and adds much-improved driver AI"[^ref-5]. The publication later named CART Racing Sports Game of the Year in their March 1998 issue[^ref-3]. Steven Levy of Macworld declared that "this champion of race games has just about everything," leading to the game receiving Macworld's 1996 Best Sports Game award[^ref-5].

Computer Games Strategy Plus recognized IndyCar Racing II as the best computer racing simulation of 1995[^ref-5]. Computer Gaming World also nominated it as runner-up for their 1995 Simulation of the Year award[^ref-5].

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospectives continue to regard CART Racing highly within the racing simulation genre. User Twilightseer on MobyGames proclaimed it "one of the greatest racing games of all time!!" adding that "no game has come this close to the real thing"[^ref-11]. Another user, fomo, noted that "when this first came out, it had some of the best graphics for a racing game for its time. The 3D polygons still look pretty decent now, decades later actually"[^ref-12].

The game maintains an active fan community at CART Racing Headquarters (icr2.net), where dedicated players continue to develop patches, create new car sets, and share modifications nearly three decades after release[^ref-2].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames (IndyCar Racing II):** 83% critic average[^ref-11]
- **MobyGames (CART Racing):** 3.3/5 player rating[^ref-3]
- **MyAbandonware:** 4.83/5 (12 votes)[^ref-13]
- **Amazon:** 5.0/5 (1 review)[^ref-14]

## Development

### Origins

CART Racing's origins trace back to Papyrus Design Group's founding vision. David Kaemmer, inspired by subLOGIC's Flight Simulator on the TRS-80, sought to create the racing equivalent: "Just as Flight Simulator let you climb into a Cessna and see what it was like to be a private pilot, I wanted to make a program that would show someone, as much as possible, what it was like to drive a racecar"[^ref-4].

Papyrus had already established itself with Indianapolis 500: The Simulation (1989)—considered by many to be the first true racing simulation[^ref-15]—followed by IndyCar Racing (1993), which sold approximately 300,000 units worldwide[^ref-16]. The company's philosophy, as Kaemmer explained, was enabled by his partner: "My partner Omar humored me by letting me write racing sims"[^ref-4].

### Production

IndyCar Racing II represented the fourth Papyrus racing game, building upon improvements introduced in NASCAR Racing[^ref-11]. The development team worked to create accurate recreations of all fifteen circuits, with artists and designers painstakingly recording the unique aspects of each track[^ref-17].

The transition from IndyCar Racing II to CART Racing was necessitated by licensing changes following the 1996 formation of the Indy Racing League. When CART lost rights to the "IndyCar" name due to their feud with Tony George's Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Sierra modified the game, substituting "CART" for "IndyCar"[^ref-18].

**Development Credits:**[^ref-5]
- **Designers:** Adam Levesque, Brian C. Mahony, Matt Sentell, Randy Cassidy, David Kaemmer, John Wheeler
- **Producer:** Todd Farrington
- **Programmers:** Rick Genter, David L. Miller
- **Artist:** Brian C. Mahony

### Technical Achievements

The game supported SVGA resolution of 640×480, a significant improvement over earlier racing simulations[^ref-5]. The CART Racing re-release added Windows 95 Rendition 3D acceleration support, providing enhanced graphics for players with Rendition 1000 hardware[^ref-18].

Papyrus supported Sierra's short-lived Rendition 3D standard, which provided the "preferred, more visually appealing versions of the CART circuits"[^ref-18]. The base game did not have 3D acceleration, but this was later added through patches, with the CART Racing release slipstreaming these improvements[^ref-11].

### Technical Specifications

**Windows/DOS Version:**[^ref-3]
- **Resolution:** 640×480 SVGA
- **Media:** CD-ROM
- **Input Devices:** Keyboard, Mouse, Racing/Steering Wheel
- **Multiplayer:** Internet support

### Cut Content

The game notably excludes the Miami road course and Indianapolis tracks from its fifteen circuits because the simulation is based on the 1995 CART season[^ref-5]. The Homestead and Rio de Janeiro tracks are also not included for the same reason[^ref-11]. The Indianapolis track was available for the original IndyCar Racing through a separate add-on after proper licensing was secured[^ref-16].

### Version History

| Version | Date | Platform | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| IndyCar Racing II | 1996 | DOS | Original release[^ref-11] |
| IndyCar Racing II | 1996 | Windows 95 | "Windy" version with identical tracks to DOS[^ref-18] |
| IndyCar Racing II | 1996 | Macintosh | Mac release[^ref-6] |
| ICR2 Rendition | 1996 | Windows | Enhanced graphics for Rendition hardware[^ref-18] |

| Sierra Sports CART Racing | 1997 | Windows | Repackaged under Sierra Sports label[^ref-18] |
| AllAmerican Sports CART Racing | 1998 | Windows | Final release, fully patched[^ref-20] |

### Technical Issues

Several patches were created for both MS-DOS and Windows 95 versions after the initial release to address various issues[^ref-5]. The Windows version proved "nearly impossible to run on modern Windows until Second Wind patch" was developed by the fan community[^ref-2].

Common issues reported by users include:
- "Unable To Find INDYCAR.EXE" error in DOSBox[^ref-12]
- Windows version crashes on launch for some users[^ref-12]
- Incompatibility with newer operating systems[^ref-10]

The game can be run with the command "INDYCAR.EXE -h" for better graphics in the DOS version[^ref-12].

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- Road surface textures were added during development when the team noticed that Geoff Crammond had used the technique in World Circuit (1992)[^ref-16]
- Professional drivers used Papyrus games to train for real races. Kevin Harvick told the developers about his first time racing at Dover: "He had never been to the track in real life, but had been beta-testing NASCAR 4 for a couple of months and had driven hundreds of laps around the virtual Dover. He said he hadn't driven more than two laps around the real track before he had a huge wide grin behind his helmet because he felt he just knew the track"[^ref-4]
- Reverse track driving became a popular activity for players wanting to create multicar pileups[^ref-4]
- GameRevolution noted that "within days, one of my friends completed his life-long dream to lap the 2nd place car"[^ref-21]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

IndyCar Racing II sold approximately 180,000 units, which was considered a setback for Papyrus since their previous game, NASCAR Racing, had sold over 1,000,000 units[^ref-11]. The original IndyCar Racing (1993) had sold about 300,000 units worldwide[^ref-16]. Combined sales of CART games exceeded 800,000 units by January 1998[^ref-5].

The commercial underperformance was partly attributed to the game being bundled with 3D cards rather than sold as a standalone product, limiting retail visibility[^ref-3].

### Critical Perspective

CART Racing represents a pivotal moment in racing simulation history, bridging the gap between DOS-era simulations and the 3D-accelerated future. While it arrived during a transitional period for PC gaming hardware, its commitment to authenticity established standards that would influence racing games for decades.

The game's importance extends beyond its technical achievements. It demonstrated that racing simulations could attract a dedicated community willing to support and extend a title long after commercial support ended. The continued activity at fan sites and the preservation efforts at Internet Archive underscore its lasting significance[^ref-19].

However, the licensing complications that necessitated the rebrand from IndyCar Racing II to CART Racing foreshadowed ongoing challenges in preserving sports games with licensed content. As forum discussions note, "old racing and sports games with licenses are 99% no-go" for digital re-releases, and "negotiating about rights which involve companies that no longer exist, people who are no longer alive, digital platforms that no longer have commercial life, is unfortunately a big task that is often not worth the effort"[^ref-23].

## Series Continuity

CART Racing is the rebranded continuation of the IndyCar Racing series developed by Papyrus. The series began with Indianapolis 500: The Simulation in 1989, considered by many to be the first true racing simulation[^ref-15]. IndyCar Racing followed in 1993, expanding the scope to include the full CART series[^ref-16]. IndyCar Racing II (1996) introduced significant improvements including enhanced AI and SVGA graphics, before being rebranded as CART Racing in 1997 due to licensing changes[^ref-11].

The CART licensing issues reflected broader industry conflicts between CART and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which would eventually lead to the formation of separate American open-wheel racing series[^ref-18].
