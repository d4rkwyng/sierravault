## Overview

IndyCar Racing is a racing simulation video game developed by [[Papyrus Design Group]] and released in 1993 for MS-DOS.[^ref-1] Following the success of their groundbreaking Indianapolis 500: The Simulation (1989), Papyrus set out to create what many consider "the motor sports aficionado's dream come true" and "the only current driving sim where 180 mph feels like 180 mph."[^ref-2] The game was intended as a realistic simulation of CART IndyCar Racing, featuring contemporary drivers, chassis, and engines from the 1993 racing season.[^ref-3]

With an official license from CART, IndyCar Racing offered eight real track names and designs with authentic sponsors and logos, putting players behind the wheel against real IndyCar drivers on circuits including Michigan International, Nazareth PA, Laguna Seca, Portland International, Milwaukee, Loudon NH, Toronto, and Long Beach.[^ref-1][^ref-4] The game arrived "hot on the heels of Geoff Crammond's excellent Formula One Grand Prix," establishing Papyrus as one of the leading developers in sim racing—a legacy that continues to this day.[^ref-5][^ref-6]

The game's advanced physics model and texture-mapped 3D graphics were revolutionary for their time, with creator David Kaemmer stating, "I wanted to make a program that would show someone, as much as possible, what it was like to drive a racecar."[^ref-7] At its release, IndyCar Racing was "practically matching coinop racers from Sega and Namco that run on dedicated hardware specifically designed for racers"—and this was before the Sony PlayStation even launched in 1994.[^ref-8]

## Development

### Origins

IndyCar Racing was Papyrus's second racing title, developed four years after the release of Indianapolis 500: The Simulation in 1989.[^ref-10] Creator David Kaemmer founded Papyrus specifically to develop simulation games, with the vision of showing players "as much as possible, what it was like to drive a racecar."[^ref-7] Kaemmer later reflected on his confidence in the project: "I thought it would sell well because I had so much fun playing it!"[^ref-15]

The original Indianapolis 500 was developed on a modest $90,000 budget, and its success paved the way for the more ambitious IndyCar Racing project.[^ref-7] The key to the game's realism was "a very complex and accurate physics model" containing "hundreds of variables influencing car handling."[^ref-15]

### Production

Development was led by David Kaemmer with a talented team of designers and programmers. The team worked to secure official CART licensing, ensuring authentic track names, designs, sponsors, and logos.[^ref-1] However, not all drivers could be included—notable absences included Nigel Mansell and Al Unser Jr., while Mario Andretti and Danny Sullivan appeared in generic liveries.[^ref-2][^ref-5]

**Development Credits:**[^ref-5]
- **Designer:** David Kaemmer
- **Programmers:** Eugene Lin, John Wheeler, Adam Levesque, Doug McCartney, Warren Sze
- **Additional Development:** Joe McDermott, Rob Wallace

Adam Levesque, who would later go on to found Blue Fang Games, designed and produced all 3D models for the game despite having no strong background in racing when he joined Papyrus.[^ref-17][^ref-17]

### Technical Achievements

IndyCar Racing featured groundbreaking texture-mapped 3D graphics at a resolution of 320x240.[^ref-8] The game's physics simulation was revolutionary, programmed by David Kaemmer and Richard Barcia to create an authentic racing experience that matched or exceeded dedicated arcade racing hardware from Sega and Namco.[^ref-8]

The road surface textures were added after the team noticed the technique being used in World Circuit (1992), demonstrating Papyrus's commitment to visual fidelity.[^ref-1] The game also featured a replay system capable of storing around one hour of footage.[^ref-2]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

IndyCar Racing shipped over 400,000 units to retailers by 1999, making it a significant commercial success for Papyrus.[^ref-2] The game was a top-five seller for 1994, establishing Papyrus as a major force in the racing simulation genre.[^ref-17] According to GameSpot, IndyCar Racing sold approximately 300,000 copies, building on the 200,000 copies sold by the original Indianapolis 500.[^ref-7]

The game's success led to Sierra On-Line's acquisition of Papyrus in 1995, with "nothing but NASCAR Racing releases after 1999" following the Sierra acquisition.[^ref-20] GameSpot's retrospective noted that "to say that the last decade and a half of computer driving would have suffered had Papyrus not been at the wheel is a serious understatement."[^ref-21]

### Awards

- **SIIA CODiE Awards 1994:** Best Sports Program[^ref-2][^ref-12]
- **Computer Gaming World 1994:** Simulation Game of the Year[^ref-1][^ref-2]
- **Computer Gaming World 1994:** Best Female Voice-Over Acting (Virginia Capers)[^ref-1]
- **Electronic Entertainment 1994:** Editors' Choice Awards – Best Game (Honorable Mention)[^ref-1]

### Expansion Packs

Two expansion packs were released for IndyCar Racing:[^ref-22]

- **Indianapolis Motor Speedway Expansion Pack** (1994) – Added the iconic Indianapolis oval track[^ref-1]
- **IndyCar Circuits** (1994) – Additional tracks from the CART circuit[^ref-1]

These expansions brought the total track count from 8 to 15, addressing fan demand for more circuits and finally including the Indianapolis Motor Speedway that was absent from the original release.[^ref-5]

### Platform Availability

The game has been preserved and is available through various abandonware and archive sites. The Internet Archive hosts installation packages that have been tested to run using DOSBox on modern Windows operating systems including Windows 11.[^ref-22]

### Critical Perspective

IndyCar Racing represents a pivotal moment in racing simulation history, bridging the gap between the pioneering but limited Indianapolis 500: The Simulation and the genre-defining NASCAR Racing series that would follow. Its success proved that there was a substantial market for hardcore racing simulations on PC, separate from the arcade-style racing games popular on consoles.

The game's influence extends beyond its own success. Papyrus went on to create NASCAR Racing (1994), which sold over 1,000,000 copies, and eventually Grand Prix Legends (1998), which "is still considered to be one of the finest racing games of all time."[^ref-21] David Kaemmer later recovered the rights to Papyrus's racing simulation technology after the studio was shut down by Vivendi Universal in May 2004, eventually founding iRacing, which continues the Papyrus simulation legacy in the modern era.[^ref-21]
