<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 30, 2026</small>

## Overview

After Dark Games represents a unique entry in Sierra's catalog - a collection of eleven mini-games based on the beloved After Dark screensaver series.[^ref-1] Released in 1998 by Sierra Attractions in collaboration with [[Berkeley Systems]][^ref-2], this CD-ROM compilation transformed iconic screensaver characters into interactive gaming experiences for both Windows 95 and Macintosh platforms.[^ref-3] The collection featured games modeled after previously released screensavers from the After Dark series[^ref-4], including the famous Flying Toasters, Bad Dog, and Hula Girl characters that had become fixtures on office computers worldwide.[^ref-5]

The game compilation emerged during Sierra's exploration of casual gaming markets in the late 1990s[^ref-18], capitalizing on the widespread recognition of Berkeley Systems' screensaver characters. As J.C. Herz noted in The New York Times, the "sheer simplicity of these games helped make them as engaging and addictive as the mega-selling 40-hour sagas with souped-up 3-D sound and state-of-the-art computer graphics."[^ref-1] The collection maintained the "aggressively stupid" philosophy that made the original After Dark screensavers so memorable.[^ref-7]

## Story Summary

Rather than featuring a single narrative, After Dark Games presents eleven individual gaming experiences, each built around the personalities and characteristics of beloved After Dark screensaver modules.[^ref-11] The games range from arcade-style action to puzzle challenges, united by the whimsical universe established by Berkeley Systems' original screensaver creations.[^ref-12]

Characters like the Flying Toasters, which originated from creator Jack Eastman's sleep-deprived late-night programming session when "my sleep-deprived brain put wings on it" after looking at a kitchen toaster[^ref-7], became the stars of their own gaming adventures. The compilation embraced the irreverent spirit that made After Dark a cultural phenomenon, featuring everything from fish word scrambles to Bad Dog's chaotic antics.[^ref-5][^ref-13]

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The compilation features straightforward controls optimized for casual gaming sessions.[^ref-14] Each mini-game utilizes standard keyboard and mouse inputs[^ref-10], with "no complicated set-up" required - players can "just start playing."[^ref-8] The interface maintains the playful aesthetic of the original screensavers while providing functional gaming controls.[^ref-15]

### The Eleven Games

After Dark Games includes the following titles, each with "multiple levels of difficulty to challenge any player"[^ref-8]:

| Game | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Toaster Run** | Arcade | Isometric Glider clone featuring Flying Toaster and Super Guy; "Don't get burnt in the high-flying arcade action"[^ref-8][^ref-1] |
| **Bad Dog 911** | Word Puzzle | Word scramble based on Bad Dog modules[^ref-1] |
| **Mowin' Maniac** | Action | "Go crazy with Mowin' Man and turn some pesky gardeners into fertilizer"[^ref-8] |
| **Hula Girl** | Platformer | Endless 2D platforming game featuring the beloved Hula Girl character[^ref-18] |
| **Roof Rats** | Puzzle | Similar to SameGame; match and clear colored tiles[^ref-1] |
| **Zapper** | Trivia | Knowledge-based trivia game[^ref-1] |
| **Fish Shtick** | Word Puzzle | Aquatic-themed word scramble[^ref-1] |
| **Foggy Boxes** | Strategy | Classic dots and boxes game[^ref-1] |
| **MooShu Tiles** | Puzzle | Mahjong-style tile matching game[^ref-1] |
| **Rodger Dodger** | Arcade | Clone of the game Raimais[^ref-1] |
| **Solitaire** | Card | Classic card game with After Dark theming[^ref-13] |

The collection also includes "a free After Dark Games screen saver" as a bonus feature.[^ref-8]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The developers took time to produce "sharp, clear graphics, and each game has original music."[^ref-5] Players are warned not to "get burnt in the high-flying arcade action of Toaster Run"[^ref-8], while other games offer varied challenges from puzzle-solving to arcade reflexes.

One reviewer spent "two hours after I first popped the After Dark Games CD into my computer I was still sitting there, mesmerized."[^ref-12] The games were designed for quick sessions but often proved unexpectedly engaging.

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Reviewer | Notes |
|-------------|-------|----------|-------|
| GameSpot | 5.5/10 | Nicole Freeman | "Unless you have an enormous crush on Hula Girl, you can do better elsewhere"[^ref-17] |
| Computer Gaming World | N/A | Staff | "If nothing else, it makes for a good time-killer"[^ref-1] |
| The New York Times | Positive | J.C. Herz | Praised simplicity and addictiveness[^ref-1] |
| MobyGames Critics | 76% | Aggregate | Generally favorable[^ref-18] |
| Amazon | 4.1/5 | Users | 51 reviews[^ref-9] |
| MyAbandonware | 4.23/5 | Community | User rating[^ref-14] |
| GameFAQs | Great | Users | 17 ratings[^ref-8] |

GameSpot's Nicole Freeman was critical, noting "games that just don't bring any life to the desktop puzzle genre" and that "each game is either a blatant rip-off of better-known games or is just so close, the only puzzle to solve will be trying to figure out what game it reminds you of."[^ref-17]

### Modern Assessment

Modern gaming databases show continued interest in the collection, with RAWG users rating it as "Exceptional."[^ref-15] The speedrunning community maintains active leaderboards for the games despite the small player base[^ref-19], indicating ongoing appeal among retro gaming enthusiasts.

MobyGames player reviews have been positive:
- "After Dark Games is a collection of eleven entertaining games with great sound and graphics. A few of the games are clones of popular games, but most of them are original." - Katakis[^ref-18]
- "A small wonder-package, which contains all those games which quickly de-stress a wound up person." - M. van Hilten[^ref-18]
- "I would say...'I know a great game package you can get for your kids...but you should not tell them that you have it for a couple of months while you play all the games!!!'" - Renee RAsul[^ref-18]

However, compatibility issues have emerged with modern systems, particularly affecting Intel Mac users who report that "the new intel processor will not recognize these old games."[^ref-20]

## Development

### Origins

After Dark Games emerged from the success of Berkeley Systems' screensaver empire, which began as creator Jack Eastman's personal project at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1986.[^ref-7] The Flying Toasters concept that became central to the collection came from a "sleep-deprived late night programming session" when Eastman looked at a kitchen toaster.[^ref-7]

Berkeley Systems maintained a philosophy to remain "aggressively stupid" in their designs[^ref-7], using "charm; creativity; non-repetitiveness; stupidity" as defining features.[^ref-7] This approach carried through to After Dark Games.

The original After Dark software was created by Jack Eastman and Patrick Beard, who programmed the early modules in assembly language to hack Mac OS calls.[^ref-7] The software later ported to Windows by Bill Stewart and Ian MacDonald.[^ref-7]

### Production

The game collection was developed as part of Sierra's acquisition and collaboration with Berkeley Systems.[^ref-7] Sierra had acquired Berkeley Systems and released After Dark Games as part of their Sierra Attractions label, focusing on casual gaming products.[^ref-18]

The production team created original music for each game and took care to produce sharp, clear graphics that matched the charm of the original screensavers.[^ref-5] The developers recognized that the appeal of After Dark lay not in technical sophistication but in personality and accessibility.

## Legacy

### Cultural Impact

After Dark Games represents a unique intersection of screensaver culture and casual gaming that emerged in the late 1990s.[^ref-23] The collection demonstrated how established digital characters could successfully transition to interactive entertainment.[^ref-12]

The Berkeley Systems founders, Joan Blades and Wes Boyd, would later leverage their success to create MoveOn.org.[^ref-7] Meanwhile, the Bad Dog character even inspired an animated TV series that aired in 1999.[^ref-7]

### Preservation Efforts

Technical preservation efforts continue through various abandonware sites and community archives[^ref-24], though users report issues with corrupted game files where "the og programming for the game isn't there."[^ref-24] Despite these challenges, the collection maintains nostalgic appeal, with players noting "This game brings back so many memories!"[^ref-24] when successful installations are achieved.

GOG wishlist requests demonstrate ongoing preservation interest, with users sharing memories: "This was one of the few games that my mother had back when I was in elementary school on our windows 2000 pc; we'd play it together at times and it's just a very simple, but cozy anthology of games that would be very nice to have preserved."[^ref-25]

Another user noted: "I'm not even here for the games. I am however, here for the massive trove/suite of screensavers/modules produced over by Berkley. To even have them running in a little window themselves would be a fascinating way to recapture a major stone of screensaver history."[^ref-25]

### Speedrunning Community

Despite its casual origins, After Dark Games maintains an active speedrunning community on Speedrun.com, with leaderboards for multiple games in the collection.[^ref-19] Players compete in categories including "Toaster Run - Easy" with recorded times and verification.[^ref-26]
