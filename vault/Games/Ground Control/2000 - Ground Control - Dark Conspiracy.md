# Ground Control: Dark Conspiracy

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

Ground Control: Dark Conspiracy is an expansion pack for the critically acclaimed real-time tactics game Ground Control, developed by High Voltage Software in collaboration with [[Massive Entertainment]] and published by [[Sierra On-Line]] in December 2000[^ref-1]. The expansion continues the story of Major Sarah Parker following the conclusion of the original game's campaign on the distant planet Krig-7B[^ref-2]. Set in the year 2419, where warfare has been outlawed on Earth and moved to the stars, Dark Conspiracy builds on Ground Control's award-winning gameplay and technology while introducing a new playable faction, the Phoenix Mercenaries[^ref-3].

What made this expansion particularly notable was Sierra's distribution strategy—the expansion was offered free to owners of the original Ground Control, with only a $4.95 shipping and handling fee required[^ref-4]. New purchasers of Ground Control would receive the expansion included at no additional cost[^ref-5]. This consumer-friendly approach was widely praised by reviewers, with IGN's Dan Adams declaring that owners who didn't take advantage of the offer were "seriously in danger of your children falling backwards on the evolutionary ladder"[^ref-6].

The expansion featured 15 new single-player missions spread across new environments, expanded the roster of units for existing factions, and continued the tactical gameplay that distinguished Ground Control from traditional resource-management focused RTS games[^ref-7]. Unlike conventional real-time strategy games, Ground Control featured no base-building or resource management—victory depended entirely on tactical deployment and maneuvering of pre-selected forces[^ref-8].

## Story Summary

The narrative of Dark Conspiracy picks up immediately where the original Ground Control concluded—with the battle for Krig-7B ended, but the greater conflict only beginning[^ref-11]. Jarred Stone and Sarah Parker, two defecting officers from the opposing factions on Krig-7B, had destroyed the alien relics that both the Crayven Corporation and the Order of the New Dawn were fighting to possess[^ref-12]. Now stranded on the deserted planet, Parker must find a way to escape while uncovering the terrifying truth about the alien technology they were fighting over[^ref-2].

After defeating the Crayven Corporation and Order of the New Dawn forces on Krig-7B, Major Sarah Parker finds herself in desperate circumstances[^ref-13]. She must enlist a group of mercenaries to help her escape from the planet—these mercenaries form the Phoenix Mercenary Unit, the expansion's new playable faction[^ref-14]. The Phoenix Mercenaries bring their own unique units and combat capabilities to the conflict, offering players a fresh tactical experience distinct from the corporate military forces of Crayven or the zealous warriors of the Order[^ref-15].

The story takes a dramatic turn when help arrives in the unlikely form of an Order of the New Dawn battlecruiser that suddenly drops out of hyperspace[^ref-24]. This vessel destroys its Crayven counterpart, creating a temporary alliance of convenience between former enemies[^ref-17]. As Parker and her mercenary allies battle across multiple planets, they gradually discover the true nature and terrifying implications of the alien artifacts that sparked the original conflict[^ref-2].

The expansion's narrative was noted for ending abruptly on a cliffhanger, leaving several plot threads unresolved and setting up potential future installments in the Ground Control saga[^ref-1]. The cutscenes throughout the campaign were produced by Blur Studio, known for their high-quality CGI work in video games[^ref-17].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Ground Control: Dark Conspiracy maintains the fully 3D interface of its predecessor, allowing players complete freedom to rotate and zoom the camera around the battlefield[^ref-18]. The game was recognized as "one of the first real 3D RTS games to be released" and was praised for having "the best system for troop movement and control" in the genre at the time[^ref-6]. Units are organized into squads rather than individual soldiers, streamlining command and control during intense tactical engagements[^ref-8].

The interface emphasizes tactical positioning over economic management—there is no base-building, no resource management, and no ability to "overwhelm the enemy with superior numbers"[^ref-8]. Instead, players must carefully select their forces before each mission and deploy them strategically throughout the engagement. The diagonal-down and top-down perspectives provide clear battlefield awareness while maintaining the detailed 3D graphics that made the original Ground Control visually impressive[^ref-9].

### Structure and Progression

The expansion features 15 all-new single-player scenarios that continue the storyline from the original game[^ref-7]. These missions take place across new environments and terrain types not seen in the base game, including at least one entirely new planetary environment[^ref-11]. Players take control of the Phoenix Mercenaries faction throughout most of the campaign, though the story involves encounters with both the Crayven Corporation and Order of the New Dawn forces[^ref-14].

Mission structure follows the tactical deployment model established in the original game—players select their forces before deployment and must complete objectives with no reinforcements or resupply during missions[^ref-18]. According to GameFAQs user data, a complete playthrough takes approximately 35 hours and is considered "Tough" in difficulty[^ref-13].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The expansion introduces several new unit types across all factions. For the Phoenix Mercenaries, players gain access to snipers, grenadiers, armored marines, the Pyrodyne anti-personnel vehicle, and Phoenix Swarm Aerodynes[^ref-6]. The existing Crayven Corporation and Order of the New Dawn factions also receive new units and weapons to expand tactical options[^ref-5].

One notable design decision that carried over from the original game was the lack of an in-mission save feature[^ref-18]. This meant that failed missions required complete restarts, and reviewers noted that "often, you'll find yourself having to memorize where attacks come from in order to prevent losing a mission"[^ref-6]. Players also cannot adjust game speed during missions, adding to the tactical tension[^ref-18]. Some technical issues persisted from the original game, including pathfinding problems with ground vehicles and units occasionally "playing bumper cars" when moving in formation[^ref-6].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Ground Control: Dark Conspiracy received generally favorable reviews from gaming publications, with critics praising its value proposition while noting that it didn't significantly evolve the formula established by the original game.

GameZone awarded the expansion **8.5/10**, with reviewer Michael Lafferty calling it "a great add-on to a fine RTS title" and declaring that "value-wise, you can't beat an expansion pack like this"[^ref-20]. The review highlighted how Sierra's decision to essentially give the expansion away free represented exceptional consumer value.

IGN gave the expansion **8/10**, with Dan Adams stating that despite expansion packs "permanently falling in the shadow of their predecessor," Dark Conspiracy delivered everything fans could want[^ref-6]. He particularly praised the original Ground Control's troop movement system while noting the expansion maintained that quality.

GameSpot scored the game **7.9/10**, with Greg Kasavin observing that "Dark Conspiracy fundamentally remains the same great strategy game as its predecessor"[^ref-18]. The review noted that "Ground Control boasted some of the best graphics of any PC game released in 2000" and the expansion maintained that visual quality[^ref-18].

CNET Gamecenter awarded **80/100**, noting that "this game not only has everything that an add-on pack should have—fresh units, a new campaign, and new multiplayer maps and modes—but it has one thing that most don't: a goose-egg price tag"[^ref-21].

ActionTrip gave a more modest **73/100**, noting "there are indeed few novelties. If somebody showed me the thing after a couple of months, I wouldn't be able to tell if it were the original game or the add-on"[^ref-21].

Gaming Age provided the lowest score among aggregated reviews at **67/100**, though still within mixed-positive territory[^ref-21].

GamePower awarded **75/100**[^ref-21].

Génération 4, a French gaming publication, scored the expansion **15/20 (75%)**[^ref-10].

### Modern Assessment

## Development

### Origins

Ground Control: Dark Conspiracy was first announced in August 2000 by Sierra Studios, positioning it as an expansion to their award-winning 3D real-time strategy game[^ref-17]. The expansion was developed by Chicago-based High Voltage Software in collaboration with the original game's developer, Massive Entertainment of Sweden[^ref-11]. The development occurred approximately six months after the release of the original Ground Control in June 2000[^ref-18].

### Production

The expansion was developed to continue the Ground Control saga with substantial new content—15 single-player missions, new environments and terrain, and the introduction of a third playable faction[^ref-7]. High Voltage Software handled primary development duties on the expansion, building upon the engine and assets created by Massive Entertainment for the original game[^ref-1].

**Development Credits:**[^ref-9]
- **Designers:** Tom Smith, Jeff Marks, David A. Rodriguez, Leif Lathrop, Martin Walfisz
- **Original Game Design:** Martin Walfisz, Henrik Sebring
- **Voice Director:** Jeff Pobst
- **Composer:** Ola Strandh

The development team totaled 178 people across all contributing studios, accumulating 200 total credits[^ref-9].

### Animation Production

- **Blur Studio** – Produced all CGI cutscenes for the expansion[^ref-17]
- **Sierra Studios** – Publishing and production oversight[^ref-1]

### Technical Achievements

Ground Control was recognized at release as having "some of the best graphics of any PC game released in 2000"[^ref-18]. The fully 3D engine allowed complete camera freedom, enabling players to view the battlefield from any angle and zoom level[^ref-18]. The expansion maintained these visual standards while introducing new terrain types and environmental effects[^ref-7].

The game utilized DirectX 7 technology with textured polygon graphics[^ref-10]. The real-time tactics approach—eschewing base-building and resource gathering in favor of pure tactical combat—represented an innovative direction in the strategy game genre[^ref-8].

### Technical Issues

Several technical issues carried over from the original Ground Control.

The lack of an in-mission save feature was a deliberate design choice but proved frustrating for many players, requiring mission memorization to progress[^ref-6].

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

While specific sales figures for Dark Conspiracy were not publicly disclosed, the expansion's unique distribution strategy—offered free or nearly free to consumers—represented an innovative approach to expansion pack marketing[^ref-4]. Sierra's decision to bundle the expansion with new copies of the original game and offer it to existing owners for minimal cost was praised by critics as exceptional consumer value[^ref-20].

### Collections

The expansion was bundled with the original Ground Control in the **Ground Control: Anthology**, released in 2001[^ref-22]. This anthology was later distributed digitally through various platforms:
- **GOG.com:** Released July 8, 2015 as "Ground Control Anthology"[^ref-25]
- The original Ground Control was released as freeware on June 25, 2004, further expanding accessibility[^ref-9]
- Rebellion Developments later became distributor of the Ground Control franchise[^ref-27]

### Fan Projects

The Ground Control community has produced various fan resources including resolution changers to enable modern widescreen support[^ref-28]. The game maintained an active modding community through its multiplayer features until the WON.net shutdown in 2008[^ref-9].

### Related Publications

- **Game Manual:** Included with physical CD-ROM release[^ref-22]
- **Strategy Guides:** Various FAQ/walkthroughs created by community members, including comprehensive unit guides[^ref-12]

### Critical Perspective

Ground Control: Dark Conspiracy represents an interesting case study in expansion pack development and distribution during the early 2000s. While the expansion itself offered solid content—15 new missions, a new faction, expanded unit rosters—it was the pricing strategy that made it memorable[^ref-4]. By offering the expansion essentially free, Sierra maximized player engagement with the franchise while generating goodwill that would benefit future Ground Control releases.

The expansion's tactical gameplay remained innovative for its time, emphasizing careful planning and positioning over the resource-gathering and base-building that dominated the RTS genre[^ref-8]. This design philosophy would influence later real-time tactics games, including the sequel Ground Control II: Operation Exodus released in 2004[^ref-28]. However, the cliffhanger ending left story threads unresolved, and the narrative gap between Dark Conspiracy's 2419 setting and Ground Control II's 2741 setting represents a significant timeline jump[^ref-28].

The game's legacy is preserved through digital distribution on platforms like GOG.com, ensuring that both the original Ground Control and Dark Conspiracy remain accessible to modern players interested in experiencing one of the pioneering 3D real-time tactics games[^ref-3].

## See Also

Ground Control: Dark Conspiracy expands on the story of Major Sarah Parker, introduced in the original Ground Control, as she navigates the aftermath of the battle for Krig-7B and uncovers the truth about the alien technology. The expansion's narrative directly follows the events of Ground Control, with Parker forming an alliance with the Phoenix Mercenaries to escape the planet and confront the remnants of the Crayven Corporation and the Order of the New Dawn. This continuation of the story sets the stage for the next installment in the series, Ground Control, which would further explore the consequences of Parker's actions and the escalating conflict.

The gameplay mechanics in Dark Conspiracy build upon those introduced in Ground Control, maintaining the focus on tactical deployment and maneuvering of pre-selected forces without base-building or resource management. The addition of the Phoenix Mercenaries as a new playable faction brings fresh units and combat capabilities to the game, enhancing the tactical experience for players. This evolution in gameplay would be carried forward into Ground Control, where the series' signature blend of real-time tactics and 3D graphics would continue to shape the player's experience.

As the narrative of Dark Conspiracy concludes on a cliffhanger, it lays the groundwork for the events of Ground Control, which promises to resolve the unresolved plot threads and further explore the implications of the alien artifacts. The introduction of new factions and the expansion of existing ones in Dark Conspiracy also hints at the broader conflict that would unfold in Ground Control, where players would face new challenges and strategic opportunities. By building on the foundation established in Ground Control and expanded upon in Dark Conspiracy, the next installment in the series would offer a richer and more complex gaming experience.
