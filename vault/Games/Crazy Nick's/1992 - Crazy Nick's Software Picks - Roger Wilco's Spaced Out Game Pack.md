# Crazy Nick's Software Picks: Roger Wilco's Spaced Out Game Pack

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 16, 2026</small>

## Overview

Crazy Nick's Software Picks: Roger Wilco's Spaced Out Game Pack is a budget-priced mini-game compilation released by [[Sierra On-Line]] in 1992 as part of the Crazy Nick's Software Picks series[^ref-1]. The collection features three arcade-style games extracted from the Space Quest adventure game series, starring the beloved janitor-turned-space-hero Roger Wilco[^ref-2]. As one of five titles in the Crazy Nick's line, this pack joined similar compilations based on other Sierra franchises including King's Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, Laura Bow, and Conquests of the Longbow[^ref-3].

The pack was designed to capitalize on the popularity of Space Quest's memorable mini-game sequences by offering them as standalone entertainment[^ref-2][^ref-4]. Sierra was experimenting with lower-priced software products during this period, and the Crazy Nick's series represented an attempt to monetize existing game assets in a new format[^ref-3]. The compilation draws primarily from Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers, with one game originating from the VGA remake of the original Space Quest[^ref-5][^ref-16].

## Story Summary

The pack presents Roger Wilco as a cadet at Starfleet Academy, serving in the dual capacity of both cadet and janitor[^ref-1]. Rather than following a narrative structure, the compilation offers three discrete mini-game experiences without an overarching storyline connecting them[^ref-2].

In Ms. Astro Chicken, Roger takes on the persona of a cosmic chicken navigating a dangerous landscape filled with predators[^ref-7]. The Monolith Burger game places Roger behind the counter of the famous intergalactic fast-food establishment, serving demanding customers[^ref-7]. Finally, Sand Skimmer sends Roger across the harsh desert of Planet Kerona, attempting to reach the settlement of Ulence Flats[^ref-7].

These scenarios connect loosely to the broader Space Quest universe established in the main adventure games. The Monolith Burger location appears throughout the series as a recurring gag on fast-food culture, while Planet Kerona serves as the setting for the original Space Quest game[^ref-5]. The Ms. Astro Chicken game continues the Astro Chicken tradition established in Space Quest III, featuring a female counterpart to the original arcade character[^ref-4][^ref-19]. The Monolith Burger location appears throughout the series as a recurring gag on fast-food culture[^ref-20].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Unlike some other Crazy Nick's compilations, Roger Wilco's Spaced Out Game Pack does not feature a menu bar or options screen[^ref-5]. Players navigate between games through a simple selection interface. The games support both mouse and keyboard input, with arrow keys controlling movement and the Enter/Return key handling actions[^ref-5]. Pressing F9 allows players to quit any of the individual games[^ref-5].

The control scheme varies by mini-game, with each offering a distinct gameplay perspective[^ref-2]. Ms. Astro Chicken uses side-scrolling movement, Monolith Burger employs a top-down overhead view, and Sand Skimmer presents a behind-view racing perspective[^ref-2].

### Structure and Progression

The compilation offers three standalone mini-games without interconnected progression:

- **Ms. Astro Chicken: Flight of the Pullet:** A 2D side-scrolling game where the player controls a chicken that must fly to its destination while avoiding flying fox predators and attacking hunter dogs by laying eggs on their heads[^ref-7][^ref-8]
- **Monolith Burger:** An overhead-view game where Roger works at a burger stand, taking customer orders and assembling burgers with the exact ingredients requested in the proper order[^ref-7]
- **Sand Skimmer:** A vehicle-based game where Roger pilots a skimmer through the desert of Planet Kerona, navigating obstacles to reach Ulence Flats[^ref-7]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Each mini-game presents distinct mechanical challenges. Ms. Astro Chicken requires players to navigate a side-scrolling environment, avoiding enemies approaching from the opposite direction while timing egg drops to neutralize ground-based threats[^ref-2]. The game demands coordination between flight controls and attack timing[^ref-5].

Monolith Burger tests memory and speed as players must remember customer orders and assemble burgers correctly while ingredients roll past on a conveyor system[^ref-5]. The gameplay becomes increasingly challenging as orders become more complex and timing more demanding[^ref-7].

Sand Skimmer functions as an obstacle-avoidance game where players pilot a hovercraft through desert terrain[^ref-2]. The vehicle perspective requires players to judge distances and navigate around hazards blocking the path to Ulence Flats[^ref-5].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Contemporary critical response to Roger Wilco's Spaced Out Game Pack was minimal, as budget compilations of this nature received limited coverage in gaming publications. The compilation was mentioned in Sierra's InterAction magazine in the Summer 1992 issue[^ref-9][^ref-18].

The pack received harsh criticism from some players who encountered the games. One reviewer described the experience as "a horrible, horrible mess and a complete waste of time," criticizing the slow character movement and poor control responsiveness[^ref-8]. The same critic noted that "if the games responded to your controls in a timely manner, they might have been entertaining for a minute or two"[^ref-8].

### Modern Assessment

Modern assessments of the compilation vary considerably. Some Space Quest enthusiasts consider it "an absolute must have for Space Quest fans," praising the opportunity to enjoy standalone versions of memorable mini-games[^ref-4]. The nostalgia factor plays heavily in positive reviews, with users recalling fond memories of playing the games in various settings[^ref-4].

The MyAbandonware community has given the title a perfect 5/5 rating based on 4 user votes, reflecting continued interest from retro gaming enthusiasts[^ref-4]. CDRomance reports over 1,316 downloads of the compilation[^ref-3].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MyAbandonware:** 5/5 (4 votes)[^ref-4]
- **FreeGameEmpire:** 1/5[^ref-7]

## Development

### Origins

The Crazy Nick's Software Picks series emerged from Sierra's strategy to leverage existing game assets for budget-priced products[^ref-3]. By extracting popular mini-games from full adventure titles, Sierra could offer affordable entertainment while maximizing the value of their development investments. The series concept allowed fans to enjoy specific gameplay sequences without purchasing or replaying entire adventure games[^ref-3].

Space Quest creator Scott Murphy had established a distinct tone for the series, wanting to create "a game that was more fun" compared to Sierra's more serious medieval offerings[^ref-10]. Murphy noted that "Sierra was in a mindset where everything was medieval and it was all fairly serious," and he embraced concepts like "fun death" where "if the player is gonna die or fail, they should at least get a laugh out of it"[^ref-10].

### Production

The compilation was developed internally at Sierra On-Line under the direction of Bill Davis[^ref-2]. The production team assembled existing mini-games from Space Quest IV and the Space Quest I VGA remake into a cohesive package[^ref-5]. The music tracks were taken directly from the source games without re-recording[^ref-5].

**Development Credits:**[^ref-2]
- **Director:** Bill Davis
- **Producers:** Tony Caudill, [[Tammy Dargan]]
- **Software Supervisor:** J. Mark Hood
- **Lead Programmer:** Thaddeus M. Pritchard
- **Quality Assurance:** Michael Brosius
- **Special Thanks:** Randy MacNeill

### Technical Achievements

The pack utilized Sierra's SCI1.1 interpreter, maintaining compatibility with the source games' technical standards[^ref-6]. The engine supported multiple display modes and sound card configurations common to Sierra products of the era[^ref-2].

The compilation runs within the ScummVM emulator framework, ensuring modern compatibility for preservation purposes[^ref-3]. DOSBox support was confirmed on version 0.58 and later[^ref-4].

### Technical Specifications

**MS-DOS Version:**[^ref-4]
- **Engine:** SCI1.1[^ref-6]
- **Audio:** PC Speaker, Sound Blaster support[^ref-8]
- **File Size:** 442 KB[^ref-4]

The game executables include PLAY.BAT, PLAY2.EXE, and SCIDHUV.EXE[^ref-11].

### Cut Content

No documented cut content exists specifically for this compilation, as the games were extracted from existing Space Quest titles rather than developed as original content.

### Version History

| Version | Date | Platform | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| 1.0 | June 5, 1992 | IBM PC | Initial release[^ref-9] |
| Alternate | 1993 | DOS | Secondary release year noted in some sources[^ref-4] |

**SCI Interpreter Version:**[^ref-6]

| Game Version | Interpreter | Type | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|------|-------|
| 1.0 | SCI1.1 | SCI1.1 | Standard release |

### Technical Issues

Players have reported control responsiveness issues, particularly with mouse input[^ref-8]. The extremely slow character movement in certain games frustrated players expecting arcade-style reaction times[^ref-8]. Issues with serial ball mouse controls were specifically noted as problematic[^ref-8].

One user reported that the download configuration did not properly enable Sound Blaster music playback[^ref-4].

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- **Ms. Astro Chicken** appears as an arcade game within Space Quest IV, where it can be played but is not required to complete the main adventure[^ref-8]
- The compilation represents mini-games that originally served as brief diversions within larger narrative experiences[^ref-5]
- The Sand Skimmer game originates from the Space Quest 1 VGA remake rather than Space Quest IV[^ref-5]
- Music tracks are recycled directly from Space Quest 4 (Main Menu theme, Ms. Astro Chicken music, Monolith Burger music) and Space Quest 1 VGA (Sand Skimmer music)[^ref-5]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Specific sales figures for Roger Wilco's Spaced Out Game Pack have not been documented. The Crazy Nick's Software Picks series as a whole represented Sierra's experiment with budget software pricing, with all five titles releasing in 1992[^ref-3].

The broader Space Quest series achieved considerable commercial success, with combined sales surpassing 1.2 million units by the end of March 1996[^ref-12]. However, this figure encompasses the main adventure game releases rather than budget compilations.

### Collections

Roger Wilco's Spaced Out Game Pack was part of the five-title Crazy Nick's Software Picks series that included[^ref-3]:
- King Graham's Board Game Challenge
- Parlor Games with Laura Bow  
- Robin Hood's Game of Skill and Chance
- Leisure Suit Larry Casino
- Roger Wilco's Spaced Out Game Pack

The game is compatible with ScummVM, ensuring preservation through modern emulation platforms[^ref-3][^ref-17].

### Fan Projects

The Space Quest series has maintained an active fan community. Quest Studios has preserved and distributed digital soundtrack recordings from the Space Quest games, including the music heard in this compilation[^ref-13][^ref-14]. The Space Quest IV soundtrack was reorchestrated and remixed by Troels Pleimert in 2020, demonstrating continued fan interest in the franchise's musical legacy[^ref-15].

### Related Publications

- **InterAction Magazine Vol. 5, No. 2 (Summer 1992):** Featured the game in the News Notes section, pages 14-15[^ref-9]

### Critical Perspective

Crazy Nick's Software Picks: Roger Wilco's Spaced Out Game Pack represents an interesting artifact of early 1990s software publishing strategies. Sierra's attempt to create value from existing assets foreshadowed later industry practices of releasing mini-game collections and budget re-releases. However, the compilation also demonstrates the limitations of extracting arcade sequences designed as brief diversions and presenting them as standalone entertainment[^ref-8].

The pack's legacy is largely overshadowed by the main Space Quest series, which critics have called "beloved cult classics" that "defined the form" of comedic adventure gaming[^ref-10]. While the mini-games served their original purpose of providing variety within larger adventure narratives, their extraction into a standalone product revealed weaknesses in control design and replay value that were less apparent in their original context[^ref-8].

## See Also

Roger Wilco's Spaced Out Game Pack draws content from multiple Space Quest games, primarily Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers (1991) and the Space Quest I VGA remake (1991)[^ref-5]. The mini-games preserve moments from these titles in an accessible standalone format, allowing players to experience arcade sequences without engaging with the full adventure game structure.

Within the Space Quest series timeline, this compilation was released between the Space Quest I VGA remake and Space Quest V: The Next Mutation[^ref-2]. The pack serves as a companion piece rather than a narrative continuation, offering no new story content to the Space Quest universe.
