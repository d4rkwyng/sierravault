# Crazy Nick's Software Picks: King Graham's Board Game Challenge

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 31, 2026</small>

## Overview

**Crazy Nick's Software Picks: King Graham's Board Game Challenge** is a compilation of classic board games released by Sierra On-Line in 1992.[^ref-1] The game features traditional board games including Checkers and Backgammon, played against King Graham from the King's Quest adventure game series.[^ref-2] As part of the Crazy Nick's Software Picks series, it represents Sierra's venture into budget gaming compilations that repurposed content from their larger adventure and Hoyle game collections.[^ref-3]

The game was developed using Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI) engine, specifically version SCI1.1,[^ref-4] and designed by Bridget McKenna and Marti McKenna.[^ref-5] After making award-winning adventure games for years, Sierra wanted to do something different, creating the overlooked Crazy Nick series as an experiment in budget gaming.[^ref-1] In the summer of 1992, Sierra combined mini arcade sequences, casino and board games that were originally included in various adventure and Hoyle games, and released these mini compilations as budget releases in blister cards.[^ref-6]

King Graham's Board Game Challenge represents a marked improvement over earlier entries in the Crazy Nick's series, with one reviewer noting that "Maybe Crazy Nick realised that Nine Men's Morris was the only game in the first set that was actually a game and not a broken mess, so he set his Sierra buddies onto making a set of proper, colourful games."[^ref-9]

## Story Summary

The game features King Graham from the King's Quest adventure game series as the primary opponent for both board games.[^ref-2] Players engage with the familiar character in a more casual gaming context, removed from the narrative adventures of the main King's Quest series. The game maintains the character's royal persona, with one screenshot caption noting "You are entitled to droit de seigneur, after all, in Backgammon as in many things."[^ref-8]

King Graham, the beloved hero of the King's Quest series who had saved the kingdom of Daventry multiple times, takes a break from dragon-slaying and quest-completing to challenge players to friendly games of strategy. His presence brings a touch of fantasy flair to traditional board games, making them more appealing to fans of Sierra's adventure game universe.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The game utilizes mouse controls for gameplay interaction.[^ref-7] The games take up the full screen, a significant improvement over earlier entries in the series that featured cramped playing areas.[^ref-9] The interface features persistent scoring to track player progress across multiple games, encouraging extended play sessions.[^ref-9]

The visual presentation represents an upgrade from earlier Crazy Nick titles, with colorful graphics that make the games visually engaging. Screenshots were captured at 320x200 resolution, typical for DOS games of the era.[^ref-8]

### Structure and Progression

King Graham's Board Game Challenge focuses on two classic tabletop games: Checkers and Backgammon.[^ref-2] The game supports 2 players[^ref-7] and allows for strategic gameplay against the AI-controlled King Graham. Players can challenge themselves to beat the royal opponent repeatedly, improving their skills over time.

**Backgammon**

The object of Backgammon is to be the first to move all one's pieces 'Home'.[^ref-6] One player moves pieces in a clockwise direction and the other moves counterclockwise, with pieces advancing corresponding to the numbers on the thrown dice. When one of your pieces lands on a point which has only one opponent's piece on it, then the opponent's piece is sent to the 'Bar' and the opponent cannot proceed until it is reentered on the board.

In the game, players can double their bets, adding a gambling element to the strategy.[^ref-9] The turns progress quickly enough to maintain engagement, avoiding the tedium that could come from slow AI decision-making.[^ref-9]

**Checkers**

Checkers is an ancient game of strategy where opponents try to capture all of the other players' pieces or render them immobile.[^ref-6] Each player has 12 checkers (called pawns) which may only move forward on the diagonals. When a pawn advances to the opponent's back row, that pawn becomes a King and may now move backwards on the diagonals as well as forward.

Pieces move only 1 space at a time unless you can make a jump, in which case you may move two spaces to the empty space just beyond the opponent's piece, which is then removed from the board.[^ref-6] The implementation follows standard checkers rules faithfully.

### Game Origins

The board games featured in King Graham's Board Game Challenge were originally games included in Hoyle Official Book of Games Volume 3: Great Board Games.[^ref-6] Sierra repackaged this content with the King's Quest theming to create an affordable entry point for players interested in either the board games or the King's Quest universe.

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Rather than adventure game puzzles, the title focuses on the strategic mechanics inherent to Checkers and Backgammon. The game is essentially "a cut-down version of Hoyle 3,"[^ref-1] repurposing the board game implementations from Sierra's larger Hoyle game collections. The mechanics stay true to the traditional rules of both featured board games, with one reviewer confirming "if you want to play a couple of board games in DOS, this is certainly one way to do it."[^ref-9]

The game is described as a faithful recreation of these traditional board games for authentic strategy and fun.[^ref-10] King Graham provides a worthy opponent, offering enough challenge to engage players while remaining accessible to newcomers.

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| MobyGames | 4.4/5 | Reviewer Katakis described it as "cut-down version of Hoyle 3"[^ref-1] |
| MyAbandonware | 4.38/5 | Described as "a really nice simulation game"[^ref-11] |

The game received positive reception from users who appreciated its straightforward approach to classic board games.

### Modern Assessment

The game has maintained a positive reception among retro gaming enthusiasts, with modern reviewers appreciating its straightforward approach to classic board games.[^ref-10] The Super Adventures in Gaming blog provided a detailed retrospective:

"The games take up the full screen this time around, and there's persistent scoring to boot. You can double in Backgammon and the turns progress quickly enough. If you want to play a couple of board games in DOS, this is certainly one way to do it."[^ref-9]

However, some reviewers expressed skepticism about the "Crazy Nick" branding in general, with one stating: "I'm starting to doubt Crazy Nick's taste in games. These games don't sound particularly crazy to me."[^ref-9] This observation highlights the mismatch between the budget series' provocative naming and the traditional content it contained.

The game represents a quality improvement within the Crazy Nick series. While earlier titles in the series were criticized for being "broken mess[es],"[^ref-9] King Graham's Board Game Challenge delivered functional, entertaining board game implementations.

## Development

### Origins

The Crazy Nick's Software Picks series emerged from Sierra's desire to create budget gaming options using existing content from their adventure game and Hoyle collections.[^ref-6] The series consisted of 5 mini-game compilations released in 1992, each based on previous Sierra adventure game franchises:[^ref-12]

1. **King Graham's Board Game Challenge** (Checkers and Backgammon with King's Quest theming)
2. **Leisure Suit Larry's Casino** (Casino games with Larry Laffer)
3. **Parlor Games with Laura Bow** (Parlor games with the detective heroine)
4. **Robin Hood's Games of Skill and Chance** (Games featuring Conquests of the Longbow character)
5. **Roger Wilco's Spaced Out Game Pack** (Arcade-style games with Space Quest's hero)

### Production

The game was developed by Sierra On-Line and designed by Bridget McKenna and Marti McKenna.[^ref-5] Music composition was handled by Robert Atesalp.[^ref-13] The development team focused on creating proper, colorful games that would represent an improvement over earlier entries in the Crazy Nick's series.[^ref-9]

The budget release strategy involved distributing the games on a single 3.5" floppy disk in blister card packaging, similar to impulse-buy items found near store checkouts.[^ref-6] This distribution method positioned the games as affordable, accessible purchases for casual gamers.

### Technical Achievements

The game runs on Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI) engine, specifically SCI1.1.[^ref-4] The technical specifications include:

| Specification | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| File Size | 776 KB[^ref-7] |
| Distribution | 3.5" floppy disk[^ref-7] |
| Resolution | 320x200[^ref-8] |
| Platform | IBM PC/DOS only[^ref-6] |

The game has been preserved and made compatible with modern systems through ScummVM,[^ref-3] ensuring continued accessibility for retro gaming enthusiasts.

### Reuse Strategy

The Crazy Nick series represented Sierra's early experiment with content recycling—taking existing game assets and repackaging them for new markets. The board game implementations from Hoyle 3 were combined with King's Quest character artwork to create a product that appealed to fans of both franchises. This strategy anticipated later industry practices of creating budget releases from existing content.

## Legacy

### Series Context

King Graham's Board Game Challenge represents part of Sierra's experimentation with budget gaming during the early 1990s.[^ref-17] While the Crazy Nick's series was described as "overlooked,"[^ref-1] it demonstrated Sierra's willingness to repurpose their existing content for different market segments.[^ref-20]

The series provided an accessible entry point to Sierra's characters and universes outside of their main adventure game lines. Players who might not invest in a full King's Quest adventure could still interact with King Graham through these casual board game challenges.

### Preservation

Modern preservation efforts have ensured that these budget compilations remain available for historical gaming research and casual play. The game is available through multiple channels:

- Abandonware sites for direct download[^ref-11]
- Internet Archive for browser-based play[^ref-18]
- ScummVM compatibility for modern systems[^ref-3]

### Historical Significance

The Crazy Nick series offers insight into Sierra's business strategies during the early 1990s. By creating budget products from existing content, Sierra could reach price-sensitive consumers and introduce their characters to new audiences. The series also demonstrates the perceived value of Sierra's character brands—the company believed that featuring King Graham, Larry Laffer, Laura Bow, Robin Hood, and Roger Wilco would help sell even simple board and arcade games.

### Connection to Hoyle Series

King Graham's Board Game Challenge demonstrates the synergy between Sierra's Hoyle gaming franchise and their adventure game properties. The underlying board game code came from the professional Hoyle series, ensuring quality gameplay, while the adventure game characters provided marketing appeal and brand recognition.
