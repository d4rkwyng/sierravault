# Crazy Nick's Software Picks: Parlor Games with Laura Bow

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

Crazy Nick's Software Picks: Parlor Games with Laura Bow is a budget compilation title released by [[Sierra On-Line]] in 1992 as part of their Crazy Nick's Software Picks series[^ref-1]. The game features Laura Bow, the protagonist of Sierra's mystery adventure series, as the player's opponent in two classic parlor games: Yacht (a dice game based on Yahtzee) and Dominoes[^ref-2]. In the summer of 1992, Sierra combined mini arcade sequences, casino, and board games that were originally included in various adventure and Hoyle games, releasing these mini compilations as budget releases in blister cards under the Crazy Nick's Software Picks banner[^ref-3].

The game is essentially a cut-down version of Hoyle Official Book of Games Volume 3, containing a subset of games from that collection with Laura Bow serving as the featured opponent character[^ref-1]. Players can challenge Laura at three different difficulty levels in both included games[^ref-2]. As a budget title designed for casual play, Parlor Games with Laura Bow offered an accessible entry point to Sierra's gaming catalog while capitalizing on the popularity of their adventure game heroines.

Contemporary and modern reception has been mixed, with critics noting that while the game was considered "above-average" for its time as a board/party game title, better versions of the included games were readily available elsewhere[^ref-4][^ref-1]. The game represents an interesting marketing experiment by Sierra to leverage their recognizable adventure game characters in more casual gaming contexts.

## Story Summary

As a budget compilation of board games, Crazy Nick's Software Picks: Parlor Games with Laura Bow does not feature a traditional narrative story. Instead, the game presents Laura Bow as the player's opponent in classic parlor games[^ref-2]. Laura Bow is a character from Sierra's adventure game series, most notably appearing in The Dagger of Amon Ra (1992), which preceded this release[^ref-2].

The framing device places players in a parlor setting where they can challenge Laura to friendly competition in Yacht or Dominoes[^ref-1]. The games proceed according to traditional rules, with Laura serving as a computerized opponent capable of varying skill levels to match player ability[^ref-2].

The connection to the Laura Bow mystery series is purely superficial, using the character's likeness and personality to add charm to what would otherwise be standard implementations of classic games[^ref-1]. This approach allowed Sierra to cross-promote their adventure game properties while offering budget-priced casual entertainment.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Parlor Games with Laura Bow utilizes Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI) engine with a point-and-select interface[^ref-2]. The game presents a side view perspective with fixed, flip-screen visuals typical of board game adaptations[^ref-2]. Players interact with game elements using mouse-driven selection, choosing dice to keep in Yacht or dominoes to play[^ref-1].

The interface and game mechanics between this title and Hoyle 3 are similar, so players familiar with the earlier release would find the controls immediately recognizable[^ref-1]. The technical specifications include a 320x200 resolution display[^ref-7].

### Structure and Progression

The game offers two distinct parlor games for players to enjoy:

- **Yacht (Yahtzee variant):** A dice game where players roll five dice and attempt to score points across various combinations. The game uses prerendered dice graphics[^ref-1]. Notably, this version lacks the "Three of a Kind" scoring line found in some Yahtzee variants, and Full House scores 12 points rather than the traditional 25[^ref-1].

- **Dominoes:** Players compete against Laura Bow in the classic tile-matching game, playing to 100 points[^ref-1]. The game follows standard dominoes rules with players taking turns matching numbered tiles.

Each game can be played at three difficulty levels, adjusting Laura's AI competence to provide appropriate challenge[^ref-2]. The turn-based pacing allows for thoughtful play without time pressure[^ref-2].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

As straightforward implementations of traditional parlor games, Parlor Games with Laura Bow does not feature adventure-style puzzles[^ref-2]. Instead, gameplay focuses on strategic decision-making inherent to each included game:

In Yacht, players must decide which dice to keep after each of three rolls per turn, then choose which scoring category to assign their result[^ref-1]. Strategic considerations include when to take a zero in a category versus attempting risky combinations.

In Dominoes, players must manage their hand of tiles strategically, blocking opponents when possible while ensuring they can continue playing[^ref-1]. The game proceeds until one player reaches 100 points.

Notably, the game lacks a save function, meaning players cannot preserve their progress between sessions[^ref-1]. There is also no two-player mode available—competition is exclusively against the AI-controlled Laura Bow[^ref-1].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Contemporary critical reception for Parlor Games with Laura Bow was limited, as the game was released as an inexpensive budget title rather than a full-priced release[^ref-3]. The Crazy Nick's Software Picks line was designed as budget releases sold in blister cards, targeting casual consumers rather than dedicated gaming enthusiasts[^ref-3].

The game was characterized as "above-average" for a board/party game title of its era[^ref-4]. However, reviewers noted the inherent limitations of the format, with one critic stating "There's absolutely no need for the hideous Yacht game to exist, and you'd have to be some kind of hard-core dominomaniac to want to play single player dominoes versus the computer"[^ref-1].

Comparative analysis with other Crazy Nick's releases found this title wanting, with critics observing "These Picks are noticeably worse than King Graham's"[^ref-1][^ref-1]. The King Graham's Board Game Challenge title in the same series received better overall reception with a reported 4.4 out of 5 player rating[^ref-8].

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospective assessment has been similarly lukewarm. Critics have noted that "If you've got the technology necessary to read these words on your computer, then you've almost certainly got access to better versions of Nine Men's Morris, Backgammon, Checkers, Yacht and Dominoes"[^ref-1]. The game's value proposition was questionable even at launch and has only diminished over time.

The game remains playable through the ScummVM emulator, which provides compatibility with modern systems[^ref-9][^ref-5]. ScummVM version 2.1 and later supports cloud saves functionality[^ref-5].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MyAbandonware:** 5/5 (10 votes)[^ref-4][^ref-10]
- **MobyGames:** Collected by 6 players[^ref-2]
- **CDRomance:** Downloaded 1,316 times[^ref-9]

## Development

### Origins

In the summer of 1992, Sierra On-Line sought to capitalize on their existing game assets by creating budget-priced compilations that would appeal to casual gamers[^ref-3]. The concept behind Crazy Nick's Software Picks was to combine mini arcade sequences, casino, and board games that were originally included in various adventure and Hoyle games, repackaging them as standalone budget releases[^ref-3].

The Laura Bow collection drew specifically from content originally developed for Hoyle Official Book of Games Volume 3[^ref-1]. By featuring recognizable characters from Sierra's adventure game library, the company aimed to cross-promote their flagship series while reaching a broader, more casual audience[^ref-3].

### Production

The development team was led by Director Bill Davis, with production oversight from Tammy Dargan and Tony Caudill[^ref-2]. J. Mark Hood served as Software Supervisor, while Thaddeus M. Pritchard handled Lead Programmer duties[^ref-2]. Quality Assurance was managed by Michael Brosius, with special thanks credited to Randy MacNeill[^ref-2].

The game was built using Sierra's SCI (Sierra's Creative Interpreter) engine, version 1.1[^ref-5]. This was the same engine powering Sierra's major adventure game releases of the period, providing a proven technical foundation for the compilation[^ref-2].

### Technical Achievements

Parlor Games with Laura Bow utilized Sierra's proven SCI1.1 engine, which provided stable performance and familiar interface conventions[^ref-5][^ref-2]. The game featured prerendered dice graphics for the Yacht game, adding visual polish to the dice-rolling mechanics[^ref-1].

One notable visual element—described critically—was a "pulsating, colour-cycling background" that some reviewers found distracting[^ref-1]. The background employed palette cycling techniques common in DOS-era games to create animated effects without additional sprite rendering overhead.

- **Scoring Differences:** The Yacht implementation lacks the "Three of a Kind" scoring line and scores Full House at 12 points rather than the traditional 25[^ref-1]
- **Visual Issues:** The pulsating, color-cycling background was criticized as "hideous" by some reviewers[^ref-1]
- **Distribution Issues:** Some download sources have reportedly hosted incorrect files, linking to the Robin Hood Crazy Nick's release instead of the Laura Bow version[^ref-10]

## Voice Cast

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

As a budget release, Parlor Games with Laura Bow was designed for low-cost retail distribution rather than premium sales[^ref-3]. The blister card packaging and low price point positioned it as an impulse purchase item. Specific sales figures have not been documented, though the game has maintained ongoing interest from retro gaming enthusiasts and abandonware collectors.

The title has been downloaded over 1,316 times from CDRomance alone[^ref-9], indicating continued interest from the retro gaming community despite its modest scope.

### Collections

Parlor Games with Laura Bow was part of the five-title Crazy Nick's Software Picks series released in 1992[^ref-9]. The complete series included:

- King Graham's Board Game Challenge (King's Quest)
- Parlor Games with Laura Bow (Laura Bow series)
- Leisure Suit Larry's Casino (Leisure Suit Larry series)
- Roger Wilco's Spaced Out Game Pack (Space Quest)
- Robin Hood's Game of Skill and Chance (Conquests series)

### Fan Projects

The game remains playable through ScummVM, which provides full compatibility with modern operating systems[^ref-9][^ref-5]. ScummVM versions 2.1 and later support cloud saves on third-party cloud storage services, adding modern convenience features to the classic title[^ref-5].

The game has been requested on GOG.com's community wishlist, receiving 17 votes from users interested in an official re-release[^ref-11].

### Related Publications

No official hint book or strategy guide was published for this budget title. The games included are based on traditional parlor games with well-established rules requiring no specialized guidance.

### Critical Perspective

Parlor Games with Laura Bow represents an interesting, if ultimately unsuccessful, experiment in Sierra's product strategy. The attempt to leverage recognizable adventure game characters in budget casual titles made commercial sense, but the execution left much to be desired. Critics consistently noted that the included games offered nothing that couldn't be found in better form elsewhere[^ref-1].

The title's primary value today lies in its connection to the Laura Bow mystery series and as a curiosity from Sierra's early 1990s diversification efforts[^ref-2]. The game demonstrates how publishers attempted to maximize returns on character IP before the era of mobile gaming made such casual character-based games commonplace.

As a historical artifact, the game documents the budget software market of the early 1990s and Sierra's willingness to experiment with different product formats[^ref-3]. However, unlike Sierra's adventure games, the Crazy Nick's series has left minimal lasting impact on gaming history.
