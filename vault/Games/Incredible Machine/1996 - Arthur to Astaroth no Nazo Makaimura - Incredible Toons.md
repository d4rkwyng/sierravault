# Arthur to Astaroth no Nazo Makaimura: Incredible Toons

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 22, 2026</small>

## Overview

Arthur to Astaroth no Nazo Makaimura: Incredible Toons is a Japan-exclusive puzzle game released on August 30, 1996, for both the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn[^ref-1][^ref-2]. The game represents a unique crossover between two distinct franchises: [[Dynamix|Dynamix's]] *The Incredible Machine* series and Capcom's beloved *Ghosts 'n Goblins* (known as *Makaimura* in Japan)[^ref-3][^ref-4]. This unusual collaboration resulted in a physics-based puzzle experience featuring the knight Arthur and the demonic creatures from Capcom's action platformer series, including chibi versions of Red Arremers and Astaroth[^ref-5].

The game stands out as the only entry in *The Incredible Machine* franchise to feature an actual plot, distinguishing it from the purely mechanical puzzle focus of its predecessors[^ref-3][^ref-6]. Players must help Arthur navigate through increasingly complex puzzle chambers by placing various machines, traps, cogwheels, and other contraptions to fulfill specific objectives such as guiding Arthur to the exit[^ref-7]. The combination of the whimsical Rube Goldberg-style mechanics with the gothic fantasy setting of the Ghosts 'n Goblins universe creates a surprisingly humorous and engaging puzzle experience[^ref-7][^ref-6].

Developed by Magical Formation Co., Ltd. under license from Dynamix, the game was published by Capcom exclusively for the Japanese market[^ref-1][^ref-9]. It features remixed music from the Ghosts 'n Goblins series and includes 100 puzzles along with an editor for creating custom puzzle designs[^ref-6][^ref-10]. The game has achieved cult status among collectors and retro gaming enthusiasts as one of the more obscure spinoffs in both franchises' histories[^ref-5].

## Story Summary

The game's narrative centers on the demon Satan, the recurring antagonist from the Ghosts 'n Goblins series who has repeatedly kidnapped Princess Prin-Prin[^ref-7]. Frustrated by Arthur's persistent heroism in rescuing the princess time and again, Satan devises a new scheme to finally defeat the valiant knight[^ref-7]. Rather than confronting Arthur directly in battle, Satan forms a pact with the powerful demon Astaroth to create a series of fiendish contraptions and impossible puzzles designed to prevent Arthur from ever reaching the princess[^ref-7].

Astaroth, drawing upon his demonic ingenuity, designs elaborate mechanical traps and physics-based challenges that would confound even the most determined hero[^ref-7]. These are not ordinary obstacles but intricate Rube Goldberg-style mechanisms featuring cogwheels, conveyor belts, bombs, and various other hazardous devices[^ref-7]. The demons believe that by creating puzzles so complex and seemingly impossible, they can keep Arthur trapped forever while the princess remains their captive[^ref-7].

However, the player assumes the role of a benevolent force working to aid Arthur in his quest[^ref-6][^ref-6]. By carefully analyzing each puzzle chamber and strategically placing the available mechanical components, the player must help Arthur navigate through Astaroth's devious creations[^ref-7]. The narrative provides context for what would otherwise be abstract puzzle challenges, giving players an emotional stake in solving each level as they work to reunite the knight with his beloved princess[^ref-7].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Arthur to Astaroth no Nazo Makaimura employs a point-and-select interface that allows players to manipulate objects within each puzzle chamber[^ref-1]. The game supports both gamepad and mouse control options, providing flexibility in how players interact with the puzzle elements[^ref-1]. Players view the action from a side perspective with 2D scrolling, allowing them to survey the entire puzzle layout before and during execution[^ref-1].

The core gameplay loop involves examining the pre-set elements of each puzzle, then selecting from available items to place strategically within the environment[^ref-7]. Once the player has positioned all their chosen components, they activate the puzzle to watch the chain reaction unfold in real-time[^ref-7]. If the setup fails to achieve the objective, players can reset and try a different configuration[^ref-7].

### Structure and Progression

The game features 100 distinct puzzles organized in sequential groups of five, creating a natural progression system with milestone achievements[^ref-12]. The achievement structure reveals the game's organizational philosophy:

- **Puzzles 1-5:** "Slow Beginning" – Tutorial-level challenges introducing basic mechanics[^ref-12]
- **Puzzles 6-10:** "Knightly Ambition" – Early complexity increase[^ref-12]
- **Puzzles 11-15:** "Battle of Minds" – Intermediate difficulty[^ref-12]
- **Puzzles 16-20:** "Fish Hunter" – Themed puzzle set[^ref-12]
- **Puzzles 21-25:** "Learning the Ropes" – Advanced mechanics introduction[^ref-12]
- **Puzzles 26-30:** "Grand Journey" – Mid-game milestone[^ref-12]
- **Puzzles 31-35:** "Jazzy Puzzling" – Stylistic variation[^ref-12]
- **Puzzles 36-40:** "Destination Castle" – Castle-themed challenges[^ref-12]
- **Puzzles 41-45:** "Thinking with Portals" – Portal mechanics[^ref-12]
- **Puzzles 46-50:** "Test of Might" – Halfway point difficulties[^ref-12]
- **Puzzles 51-55:** "Who Dares Wins" – Courage-testing challenges[^ref-12]
- **Puzzles 56-60:** "Shrimple as That" – Deceptively simple designs[^ref-12]

- **Puzzles 71-75:** "I Saw a Squirrel Today" – Whimsical themed set[^ref-12]
- **Puzzles 76-80:** "Paper Plane" – Aerial mechanics focus[^ref-12]

- **Puzzles 86-90:** "The Greatest Achievement" – Peak difficulty[^ref-12]
- **Puzzles 91-95:** "Two Minutes to Midnight" – Climactic puzzles[^ref-12]
- **Puzzles 96-100:** "2nd Loop Clear!" – Final challenge set[^ref-12]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The puzzle design draws directly from The Incredible Machine formula, requiring players to create chain reactions using various mechanical components[^ref-7][^ref-10]. Available items include machines, traps, cogwheels, and numerous other contraptions that interact with physics-based rules[^ref-7]. The objective varies by puzzle but often involves getting Arthur to reach an exit point or accomplishing specific goals within the chamber[^ref-7].

Notably, some puzzles take a dark comedic turn by requiring players to actually kill Arthur rather than save him, adding variety to the objectives[^ref-6]. The game incorporates items from the Ghosts 'n Goblins series, including the iconic armor power-up that Arthur requires to move[^ref-6]. This integration of franchise elements into puzzle mechanics creates unique challenges not found in other Incredible Machine titles.

Unlike other games in The Incredible Machine series, this title notably lacks Head-to-Head puzzles and Freeform Machine mode[^ref-3][^ref-6]. The focus remains entirely on single-player puzzle completion, though the inclusion of a puzzle editor allows for creative expression and custom challenge creation[^ref-10][^ref-7].

## Reception

## Development

### Origins

Arthur to Astaroth no Nazo Makaimura emerged from a licensing arrangement between Capcom and Sierra On-Line's subsidiary Dynamix[^ref-1][^ref-9]. The game is based on Sid & Al's Incredible Toons, which Dynamix developed and Sierra On-Line released in 1993[^ref-10][^ref-7]. Capcom recognized an opportunity to leverage the proven puzzle mechanics of The Incredible Machine series while incorporating characters from their popular Ghosts 'n Goblins franchise[^ref-3][^ref-4].

The decision to create a narrative-driven version of The Incredible Machine formula was unprecedented for the series[^ref-3][^ref-6]. While previous entries focused purely on mechanical puzzle-solving without story context, this collaboration allowed for the integration of established characters and a plot motivation for the challenges[^ref-7]. This creative choice helped differentiate the game from its predecessors while appealing to fans of the Makaimura series.

### Production

Development duties fell to Magical Formation Co., Ltd., a Japanese studio that handled the adaptation of the Incredible Toons engine for console platforms[^ref-1][^ref-9]. The team faced the challenge of translating a mouse-driven PC puzzle game to console controllers while maintaining the precision required for effective puzzle construction[^ref-1].

The developers integrated visual and audio assets from the Ghosts 'n Goblins universe, including chibi-style renditions of series enemies like the Red Arremer demons and the fearsome Astaroth[^ref-5][^ref-6]. Music from the Makaimura series was remixed for inclusion in the game, providing familiar audio accompaniment for fans of the franchise[^ref-3][^ref-6].

**Development Credits:**[^ref-1][^ref-9]
- **Developer:** Magical Formation Co., Ltd.
- **Publisher:** Capcom Co., Ltd.
- **Licensed From:** Dynamix, Inc.

### Technical Achievements

The game maintained the 2D side-scrolling perspective characteristic of The Incredible Machine series while rendering characters in the distinctive Ghosts 'n Goblins art style[^ref-1]. Screenshots indicate the PlayStation version ran at 320x240 resolution[^ref-17].

The inclusion of a puzzle editor feature allowed players to create and save their own custom levels, extending the game's longevity beyond the 100 included puzzles[^ref-10][^ref-7]. This was a significant technical implementation for a console release of the era.

### Technical Specifications

**PlayStation Version:**[^ref-14][^ref-10]
- **Resolution:** 320x240[^ref-17]
- **Media:** CD-ROM

**Sega Saturn Version:**[^ref-2][^ref-18]
- **Media:** CD-ROM
- **File Size:** ~376-406 MB[^ref-18][^ref-16]

### Cut Content

Unlike the standard Incredible Machine games, this title was released without Head-to-Head puzzles or the Freeform Machine mode that allowed completely open-ended machine building[^ref-3][^ref-6]. Whether these features were intentionally omitted or cut during development remains unclear.

### Version History

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- The game is the only entry in The Incredible Machine franchise to feature a complete narrative storyline[^ref-3][^ref-6]
- Some puzzles require players to kill Arthur rather than save him, subverting typical puzzle game objectives[^ref-6]
- The game features chibi-style renditions of Ghosts 'n Goblins enemies, including Red Arremers and Astaroth[^ref-5]
- Arthur requires the series' iconic armor power-up to move in certain puzzles, integrating franchise lore into puzzle mechanics[^ref-6]
- The achievement "Thinking with Portals" in modern achievement tracking appears to reference Valve's Portal series, added posthumously[^ref-12]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

As a Japan-exclusive release, the game had limited commercial reach outside its home market. No official sales figures have been published. The game has never been re-released digitally or included in any compilation, limiting its availability to original physical copies and emulation[^ref-19].

### Collections

Arthur to Astaroth no Nazo Makaimura has not been included in any official game collections or compilations. It remains one of the more obscure entries in both The Incredible Machine and Ghosts 'n Goblins franchises.

### Fan Projects

No significant fan projects, remakes, or translations have been documented. The game remains accessible primarily through original hardware or emulation, with ROM distributions available through various preservation sites[^ref-14][^ref-20].

### Related Publications

No official guidebooks, hint books, or related publications have been identified for this title. The GameFAQs archive contains a "Series Ending FAQ" by ReyVGM (2006) that covers multiple Ghosts 'n Goblins titles, though its specific coverage of this game appears limited[^ref-21].

### Critical Perspective

Arthur to Astaroth no Nazo Makaimura occupies a curious position in gaming history as a crossover that few knew existed. The combination of Dynamix's beloved puzzle mechanics with Capcom's iconic action franchise could have been a significant commercial success had it received wider release[^ref-5]. Instead, it remains a fascinating footnote—evidence of the creative licensing deals that characterized the 1990s gaming industry.

The game demonstrates how established puzzle frameworks could be successfully adapted with new intellectual properties, predating the modern trend of franchise crossovers by decades. For collectors and enthusiasts of either parent franchise, the game represents a rare and unusual artifact worthy of preservation[^ref-5]. Its strong user ratings suggest that despite its obscurity, those who have played it found genuine entertainment value in its unique premise[^ref-14][^ref-2].
