## Overview

The Even More Incredible Machine is a puzzle game released in 1993 that expanded upon the beloved original Incredible Machine with new content while retaining the core Rube Goldberg-inspired gameplay that made the series famous[^ref-1]. Developed by [[Jeff Tunnell Productions]] under the Dynamix banner and published by [[Sierra On-Line]], the game challenged players to build elaborate contraptions using common household objects to accomplish simple tasks through complex chain reactions[^ref-2]. The title represents a "vintage blend of educational and entertainment software at their finest," combining physics-based puzzle solving with creative sandbox gameplay[^ref-3].

The game includes 87 puzzles from the original Incredible Machine alongside 73 brand new puzzles, bringing the total to 160 levels of increasingly challenging contraption-building gameplay[^ref-4]. New parts and enhanced music accompanied these additional puzzles, offering both returning players and newcomers substantial content to explore[^ref-5]. The core gameplay remained unchanged from its predecessor—players solve puzzles using only the parts provided, arranging them in elaborate configurations to effect simple state changes like turning on a light or getting a ball into a basket[^ref-1].

Few games can offer the same sense of satisfaction that comes from seeing a plan come together, and The Even More Incredible Machine exemplifies this design philosophy[^ref-6]. Whether classified as edutainment or purely as a puzzle game, the title became recognized as "an exceptionally amusing videogaming classic" that demonstrated how physics simulation could create endlessly engaging gameplay[^ref-7]. The game's appeal extended beyond traditional gaming audiences, reportedly causing "a chain reaction that brought productive work to a halt at a major naval yard" when demonstrated to an engineer friend of the development team[^ref-3].

## Story Summary

The Even More Incredible Machine does not feature a traditional narrative storyline, as the game focuses entirely on puzzle-solving mechanics rather than plot-driven gameplay[^ref-4]. Players take on the role of an inventor or engineer tasked with completing various objectives using increasingly complex contraptions built from everyday objects and mechanical components.

Each puzzle presents a specific goal that must be accomplished—such as getting a basketball into a hoop, turning on a light, or helping a small character reach a destination—using only the parts provided in that particular level[^ref-1]. The challenges range from simple setups requiring only a few components to elaborate multi-stage machines that require precise timing and positioning of dozens of interacting elements.

The game's "Freeform Mode" allows players to transcend the structured puzzles entirely, providing a sandbox environment where they can create their own machines and scenarios without objectives or part restrictions[^ref-4]. This creative freedom became a beloved feature, with players reporting spending hours constructing elaborate contraptions for pure entertainment, such as "filling [a map] to the border with pinball bumpers...and then putting about 20 tiny little human guys in there...so they fall and bounce all over the place"[^ref-8].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The Even More Incredible Machine uses a mouse-driven point-and-click interface that allows players to select, position, and adjust various mechanical parts on a 2D playing field[^ref-4]. Players can drag components from a parts palette onto the workspace, rotate certain objects, and adjust their precise positioning to create functional machines[^ref-6]. The keyboard also supports functionality, with keys 1-9 and A-L allowing players to select different music tracks during Freeform mode gameplay[^ref-9].

The game operates on a deterministic physics engine that produces consistent results without random number generation, meaning the same machine configuration will always produce identical outcomes when activated[^ref-3]. This predictability is essential to the puzzle design, allowing players to test, iterate, and perfect their solutions through experimentation.

### Structure and Progression

The game presents 160 total puzzles organized in escalating difficulty[^ref-4]:

- **Puzzles 1-87:** Classic challenges carried over from the original Incredible Machine, providing familiar content for returning players and a solid foundation for newcomers[^ref-9]
- **Puzzles 88-160:** All-new challenges featuring additional parts and more complex solutions, representing the "even more" content promised in the title[^ref-9]
- **Freeform Mode:** An unlimited sandbox mode where players can build contraptions without objectives or restrictions[^ref-4]

The puzzles can also include variable environmental conditions, with some featuring altered gravity settings or atmospheric pressure changes that affect how objects behave[^ref-10].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The game features 45 different types of parts that players can use to build their contraptions[^ref-10]. These include common household objects, mechanical devices, and whimsical elements that interact according to simulated physics rules:

- **Mechanical Elements:** Gears, pulleys, conveyor belts, trampolines, and various switches
- **Projectiles and Containers:** Balls, balloons, baskets, and buckets
- **Power Sources:** Generators, motors, and explosive devices
- **Living Components:** Small human figures, mice, and cats that move and interact with the environment
- **Decorative/Functional:** Pinball bumpers, ramps, and various structural elements

The game emphasizes creative problem-solving, with most puzzles allowing multiple valid solutions[^ref-10]. Players must understand how different components interact—how a ball's momentum transfers through impacts, how gravity affects falling objects, and how timing sequences can trigger chain reactions—to successfully complete challenges[^ref-6].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

The Even More Incredible Machine received positive reception as an enhanced version of an already beloved puzzle game.

## Development

### Origins

The Incredible Machine concept originated with designer [[Kevin Ryan]], who had been developing ideas for a Rube Goldberg-style puzzle game for years before the opportunity to create it arose[^ref-2]. The game was inspired by multiple sources, including Bill Budge's Pinball Construction Set, the classic Mouse Trap board game, and the puzzle mechanics of Lemmings[^ref-10]. The concept drew heavily from the works of Rube Goldberg, whose elaborate cartoon contraptions depicted complex machines designed to perform simple tasks in the most convoluted way possible[^ref-2].

Three weeks after Ryan had been working on game concepts, Jeff Tunnell left a phone message offering him a job at Jeff Tunnell Productions specifically to develop "a Rube Goldberg game"[^ref-12]. This partnership would prove instrumental in bringing The Incredible Machine to life and establishing it as a successful franchise.

### Production

The original Incredible Machine was developed on a remarkably modest budget of $36,000 over approximately nine months[^ref-3]. This lean development approach was characteristic of Jeff Tunnell Productions, which operated as a smaller studio under the Dynamix umbrella while maintaining creative independence.

Jeff Tunnell Productions developed The Even More Incredible Machine after Tunnell left Dynamix to start his own company, though the studio continued to work closely with Sierra On-Line for publishing and distribution[^ref-13]. The development team focused on creating new puzzle content and additional parts while preserving the physics engine and interface that made the original game successful.

### Technical Achievements

The game's physics simulation engine was a significant technical achievement for its era, providing deterministic simulation that allowed complex multi-body interactions to be calculated in real-time[^ref-3]. Unlike many games that used random number generators for variety, The Incredible Machine's engine ensured that identical setups would produce identical results every time—a critical feature for puzzle gameplay that required precise solutions.

The engine simulated gravity, momentum, friction, and collision detection across dozens of simultaneously active objects, allowing players to create genuinely complex chain reactions[^ref-10]. The system was sophisticated enough to support variable gravity and atmospheric pressure settings in certain puzzles, demonstrating the simulation's flexibility[^ref-10].
