<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

The Incredible Machine is a groundbreaking physics-based puzzle game that challenges players to build elaborate Rube Goldberg-style contraptions to solve simple tasks[^ref-1]. Developed by [[Jeff Tunnell Productions]] and published by [[Sierra On-Line]] in 2011, the game was released in 1992 and quickly became recognized as one of the most original puzzle games ever created for personal computers[^ref-2]. The core gameplay involves arranging a given collection of objects—including ropes, pulleys, gears, bowling balls, cats, and mice—in needlessly complex fashion to perform simple tasks such as putting a baseball into a basket or turning on a fan[^ref-3].

The game's innovative design earned it recognition as a genre-defining franchise that spawned numerous sequels and inspired countless physics-based puzzle games that followed[^ref-4]. Computer Gaming World praised it as "fresh in concept and long on gameplay," noting that it reawakens "the curious, tinkering 10-year-old" within players, giving them "a digital toy box and set loose in the backyard of his or her mind"[^ref-5]. The game's physics engine was deterministic, meaning it did not use a random number generator in its simulation, assuring that the results for any given machine were reproducible—a crucial design decision that allowed players to experiment and refine their solutions[^ref-3].

The Incredible Machine was selected for inclusion in the book "1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die" and was ranked #62 in Computer Gaming World's "150 Best Games of All Time" list in 1996[^ref-1]. Its blend of educational value and entertainment made it a staple in schools while simultaneously creating "a chain reaction that brought productive work to a halt at a major naval yard," according to one reviewer[^ref-5]. IGN later described the series as "a vintage blend of educational and entertainment software at their finest"[^ref-6].

## Story Summary

The Incredible Machine has no traditional narrative or plot—it is purely a puzzle game focused on mechanical problem-solving[^ref-8]. As Hardcore Gaming 101 noted, "There's absolutely no plot to get in the way – there are puzzles to solve, 87, to be exact"[^ref-8]. Instead of following a story, players take on the role of an inventor challenged to solve increasingly complex mechanical puzzles.

The game's framing device in later versions introduced Professor Tim, a quirky scientist who welcomes players to his "subterranean machine-making lab" filled with "gazzilions of gadgets"[^ref-9]. Professor Tim serves as a guide, presenting puzzles and explaining that players have "150-plus puzzles waiting for your solutions. And guess what. They're all built out of stuff I had lying around the lab!"[^ref-9]. This light-hearted presentation gave the game personality while maintaining focus on the puzzle-solving experience.

The objectives of each puzzle vary widely, from practical goals like putting a ball in a basket to more whimsical challenges such as "feeding mice to alligators, knocking cats on the head with bowling balls, [and] flinging baseballs at children using a series of pulleys, chutes, and dynamite"[^ref-10]. The game's charm lies in the absurdity of creating impossibly complicated solutions to achieve these simple ends, embodying the spirit of American cartoonist Rube Goldberg's famous cartoon inventions[^ref-1].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The Incredible Machine uses a point-and-click interface where players select parts from a "Parts Bin" and place them on a two-dimensional playfield[^ref-11]. The interface supports both keyboard and mouse input[^ref-1]. Players can rotate and flip objects to achieve the desired orientation before placing them on the screen. Once players believe their contraption will work, they press the play button to start the simulation and watch their machine in action[^ref-12].

The game features keyboard shortcuts for various functions, including controls numbered 1-9 and letters a-g that change music in Freeform Mode[^ref-13]. The straightforward controls made the game accessible to players of all ages, contributing to its widespread appeal in both educational and entertainment contexts[^ref-14].

### Structure and Progression

The original game contains 87 puzzles organized in increasing difficulty[^ref-8]. Each puzzle presents players with a specific goal to accomplish using only the parts provided. The game uses a password system to track progress, allowing players to continue from where they left off—the password for level 87 is "GULF"[^ref-15].

The game offers two primary modes of play:

- **Puzzle Mode:** Players must solve pre-designed puzzles using only the limited parts provided for each challenge[^ref-1]
- **Freeform Mode:** An open sandbox where players have access to unlimited parts to create their own contraptions and custom puzzles[^ref-1]

Some puzzles feature modified physics parameters, with different gravity or air pressure settings that add variety and challenge to the gameplay[^ref-1]. This variability meant that solutions which worked under normal conditions might fail under altered physics, requiring players to think creatively about how environmental factors affect their machines.

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The game features approximately 45 different parts that players can use to construct their machines[^ref-16]. These include:

- **Mechanical components:** Ropes, pulleys, gears, conveyor belts, levers, seesaws[^ref-17]
- **Power sources:** Electric generators, motors, fans, bellows[^ref-1]
- **Projectiles and objects:** Bowling balls, baseballs, basketballs, balloons[^ref-17]
- **Living creatures:** Cats, mice (including treadmill mice), bike-riding monkeys[^ref-17]
- **Explosive elements:** Dynamite, fireworks, lasers[^ref-18]
- **Household items:** Trampolines, candles, magnifying glasses, buckets[^ref-1]

Each object behaves according to real-world physics, adding an extra layer of complexity to puzzle solutions[^ref-19]. The physics engine simulates gravity, momentum, air pressure, and object interactions with remarkable precision for its era[^ref-3]. As one review noted, "TIM forces your brain to work quite hard. But hard in a funny way, since your goal is to build literally an 'incredible' machine"[^ref-20].

The puzzles allow for multiple solutions, as Jimmy Maher of The Digital Antiquarian observed: "The experience of working through the stages of a solution, getting a little closer each time, is almost indescribably satisfying for anyone with the slightest hint of a tinkering spirit"[^ref-16]. This open-ended design encouraged experimentation and creativity, distinguishing the game from more rigid puzzle games of its era.

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

The Incredible Machine received widespread critical acclaim upon release. Computer Gaming World's Neil Harris noted that the game caused "a chain reaction that brought productive work to a halt at a major naval yard," illustrating its addictive appeal[^ref-5]. The publication praised it as "fresh in concept and long on gameplay"[^ref-5]. Dragon magazine awarded the game 4 out of 5 stars in their 1993 review[^ref-5].

The game won several awards due to its innovative style and simulation abilities[^ref-3]. It was recognized at the 1993 Game Developers Conference and later inducted into the Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame in 2006[^ref-1]. Power Play magazine named The Incredible Machine 2 the Best Puzzle Game of 1995[^ref-21].

Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewed the 3DO version, giving it a score of 7.25/10[^ref-5]. The All Game Guide gave The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions a 90/100, noting that "although the game applies properties of physics to problem solving, it is so delightfully entertaining that gamers of all ages won't realize the depth of learning involved"[^ref-22].

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospectives continue to hold The Incredible Machine in high regard. Games Nostalgia describes it as "one of the most original puzzle games ever created for personal computers" that "challenges players to build elaborate contraptions using a variety of objects, all governed by real-world physics"[^ref-2]. GOG.com users have rated The Incredible Machine Mega Pack 4.5 out of 5 stars[^ref-23], with reviewers calling it "a must-buy for any puzzle game fan!" and debating whether it might be the "best puzzle game ever"[^ref-23].

The game's influence on subsequent titles has been widely acknowledged. As one GOG reviewer noted, "The fact that a lot of the latest successful indie games like Armadillo Run are still copying this age old formula says enough"[^ref-23]. MyAbandonware users give the game a 4.4 out of 5 rating[^ref-24], with one enthusiastic player declaring it "quite literally the best DOS ROM I've ever played. The machine truly is incredible"[^ref-25].

**Aggregate Scores:**

## Development

### Origins

The concept for The Incredible Machine originated in 1983 when [[Jeff Tunnell]] and Damon Slye first conceived the idea[^ref-16]. The game was originally planned for development by Electronic Arts for the Commodore 64 in 1984, but that project never materialized[^ref-5]. The concept lay dormant for nearly a decade before Tunnell revisited it in the early 1990s.

After leaving Dynamix in 1991, Jeff Tunnell founded Jeff Tunnell Productions in early 1992 as a one-man casual/children's game developer[^ref-27]. As Jimmy Maher noted, "If Tunnell hoped to innovate, he would have to return to the guerrilla model of game development"[^ref-16]. The small studio's focus on experimental and creative gameplay concepts led directly to the development of The Incredible Machine[^ref-2].

The game drew inspiration from multiple sources. The Mouse Trap board game provided a key influence, as did the 1991 hit puzzle game Lemmings, which demonstrated the commercial viability of physics-based puzzle games with multiple solutions[^ref-16]. Most fundamentally, the game was inspired by the iconic cartoon inventions of American cartoonist Rube Goldberg, whose elaborate contraptions designed to perform simple tasks in needlessly complicated ways became the game's central design philosophy[^ref-1].

### Production

[[Kevin Ryan]] programmed The Incredible Machine in just nine months on a remarkably modest budget of $36,000 (equivalent to approximately $78,361 in 2024)[^ref-5]. Ryan utilized coding expertise and actual code from vehicular simulators he had previously built at Dynamix, allowing him to get the basic engine working within a handful of months[^ref-16].

The physics engine was designed to be deterministic, avoiding random number generators to ensure that identical setups would always produce identical results[^ref-3]. This was a critical design decision, as Kevin Ryan later explained: "Chaos theory is where very small differences in the starting conditions of a dynamic system can result in completely different final results. Move a tennis ball over by just 0.0001 units and it may bounce off a teeter-totter a fraction of a second later and then make something else bounce left instead of right"[^ref-28]. To combat this "butterfly effect," Ryan developed custom mathematical routines using integer-based calculations rather than floating-point numbers, ensuring cross-platform consistency[^ref-28].

**Development Credits:**[^ref-1][^ref-21]
- **Designer:** [[Jeff Tunnell]]
- **Designer/Programmer:** Kevin Ryan
- **Composer:** Christopher Stevens

The game was developed for Jeff Tunnell Productions and published through Sierra On-Line as part of their Discovery Series[^ref-29]. The relationship with Sierra allowed the small development team to benefit from the larger publisher's marketing and distribution capabilities. As Ken Williams of Sierra noted, "to me, Sierra was a marketing company. Lots of people can design products, advertise products, and sell products. But what really lifted Sierra above the pack was our marketing"[^ref-16].

### Technical Achievements

The game's physics engine was groundbreaking for its time. Using integer-based calculations rather than floating-point mathematics, the engine achieved deterministic simulation results across different platforms[^ref-28]. This meant that any player could share their machine design with another player and be confident that it would behave identically on both systems.

The engine simulated realistic physical properties including gravity, momentum, air pressure, and object collisions[^ref-3]. With 45 different parts available, the system had to track complex interactions between multiple moving objects simultaneously[^ref-16]. The technical achievement was particularly impressive given the hardware limitations of early 1990s computers, which required the game to run on systems as modest as an Intel 386SX processor with only 640 KB of RAM[^ref-30].

The game supported multiple graphics modes including EGA and VGA, and could run in VGA 640x448 resolution with 16 colors[^ref-30]. Sound support included AdLib sound cards for enhanced audio[^ref-7].

**Japanese Localization:**
The game was released in Japan under the alternate title インクレディブル・マシーン (Inkurediburu Mashīn) for the FM Towns and PC-98 platforms[^ref-24]. The FM Towns Marty console version was part of Fujitsu's attempt to convert their computer platform into a video game console, though the device ultimately failed to reach even 5% of expected sales due to being "the worst of both worlds: too limited and underpowered as a computer, and too overpriced as a console"[^ref-32].

### Technical Issues

Several technical issues have been documented:
- Game physics occasionally exhibited broken behavior[^ref-25]
- The original DOS version doesn't work properly in 64K memory configurations[^ref-24]
- Small window and fullscreen issues occur when running in DOSBox[^ref-24]
- STB video card compatibility required a dedicated driver update[^ref-33]

Sierra Help provides patches and updated installers to allow the game to run on modern Windows systems using DOSBox emulation[^ref-34].

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

The game includes several hidden features and seasonal variations:
- **Christmas Day Easter Egg:** Playing on December 25th reveals special holiday-themed balloons[^ref-1]
- **Valentine's Day Easter Egg:** Heart-shaped balloons appear when playing on February 14th[^ref-1]
- **Holiday Parts:** The level editor contains secret holiday-themed parts that can be unlocked[^ref-23]

Additional trivia:
- The game was used in 3rd grade keyboarding classes for educational purposes[^ref-24]
- One player famously "got kicked out of the computer lab for playing it during class" while in college[^ref-25]
- The character Pokey the cat was named after Gumby's pony, and Mortimer Mouse was originally a planned name for Mickey Mouse[^ref-35]

## Voice Cast

The original Incredible Machine does not feature voice acting. Later versions in the series, including The Incredible Machine 3 and Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions, included Professor Tim as a voiced character providing puzzle introductions and hints[^ref-9].

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

The Incredible Machine series sold over one million copies by the year 2000[^ref-36], establishing it as one of Sierra's most commercially successful properties outside their adventure game catalog. The game achieved what one MyAbandonware reviewer called the distinction of being "possibly the best non-adventure game Sierra ever made"[^ref-25].

Jeff Tunnell noted that the series became "a genre defining franchise"[^ref-4], inspiring an entire generation of physics-based puzzle games. The game's influence can be seen in modern titles like Armadillo Run, World of Goo, and countless mobile physics puzzlers[^ref-23].

### Fan Projects

**Contraption Maker (2014):**
Jeff Tunnell and his son Jon Tunnell developed Contraption Maker through their company Spotkin as a spiritual successor to The Incredible Machine[^ref-43]. Kevin Ryan, the original programmer, also contributed to this project[^ref-28]. As PCGamesN noted, "Contraption Maker is a true second-generation game"[^ref-43], featuring modern physics, online multiplayer for up to 8 players, Steam Workshop integration, and over 200 different parts[^ref-44].

The game was released on Steam Early Access in 2013 and reached version 1.0 in 2014[^ref-45]. PC Gamer praised it as being "already worth your time and money," calling it "a recognisable heir to the throne" of the original[^ref-45]. YouTuber Markiplier declared "It's an amazing game and I love it to pieces"[^ref-45].

### Related Publications

- **Game Manual:** The original DOS manual was notably extensive, measuring more than 14 times the size of the game file itself[^ref-24]
- **Sierra Help Walkthrough:** Comprehensive puzzle solutions available through Sierra Help Pages[^ref-15]

### IP Ownership

The intellectual property rights to The Incredible Machine have changed hands several times:
- Originally owned by Sierra On-Line/Dynamix[^ref-1]
- Acquired by PushButton Labs in 2009[^ref-38]
- Currently owned by The Walt Disney Company through their acquisition of Playdom[^ref-38]

Jeff Tunnell and his team earned a patent (US Patent #5577185) for the game concepts developed in Sid & Al's Incredible Toons[^ref-3][^ref-4].

### Critical Perspective

The Incredible Machine represents a pivotal moment in puzzle game design, establishing the template for the physics-based puzzle genre that would flourish in the decades that followed. Its combination of educational value with genuinely entertaining gameplay proved that "edutainment" software need not sacrifice fun for learning. As one reviewer eloquently stated, the game offers "a dream come true for anyone who as a child likes to tinker with gadgets and toys"[^ref-24].

The game's deterministic physics engine was revolutionary for its time and demonstrated that complex simulations could run on consumer hardware while remaining accessible to casual players. Kevin Ryan's technical achievement in creating integer-based physics calculations that remained consistent across platforms established principles that continue to influence game development today[^ref-28].

Few games can offer the same sense of satisfaction that comes from seeing a plan come together[^ref-19]. The Incredible Machine proved that puzzle games could be about creative expression as much as logical deduction, giving players tools to experiment and create rather than simply follow predetermined solutions. This philosophy of empowering player creativity would later become central to sandbox games and creative platforms like Minecraft.

The game's influence extends beyond entertainment into education. Schools recognized its potential for teaching physics concepts, engineering principles, and logical thinking[^ref-8]. Its use in classrooms—alongside its tendency to distract workers in offices and naval yards[^ref-5]—demonstrated the universal appeal of its core concept.

As Jeff Tunnell reflected on the franchise's 30th anniversary, "Working on Contraption Maker with modern processors and GPU's, huge memory, connectivity, and high definition monitors is like being in a dream world"[^ref-45]. Yet the original game's elegant simplicity—challenging players to build elaborate contraptions using nothing more than their imagination and a carefully curated selection of virtual parts—remains as compelling today as it was in 1992.
