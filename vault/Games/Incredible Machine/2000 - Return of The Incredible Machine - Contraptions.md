<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

**Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions** is a 2000 puzzle strategy game that revitalized the beloved Incredible Machine series after a five-year hiatus[^ref-1]. Developed by Sierra Entertainment with Jeff Tunnell Productions, the game challenges players to "create off-the-wall gadgets using a combination of everyday flumadiddles, doohickeys, and gigamarees"[^ref-2]. The gameplay is virtually identical to previous games in the series, requiring players to use mechanical components to create Rube Goldberg-like devices that accomplish specific goals[^ref-2][^ref-2].

The game features over 250 puzzles alongside a freeform invention mode, allowing players to construct fantastic machines that accomplish unusual tasks ranging from catching cats in baskets to lighting fireworks with laser beams[^ref-5][^ref-6]. As one New York Times reviewer noted, the game is "so absorbing" that "ruminations inspired by its more than 250 graphical conundrums have been intruding regularly upon the real world"[^ref-1].

## Story Summary

The game opens with Professor Tim (or simply "the professor") welcoming the player to his secret inventor's complex, explaining that he has been overworked and needs to hire an apprentice[^ref-2]. Players take on the role of this apprentice, working through increasingly complex contraption challenges under the professor's guidance. The narrative framework is minimal but charming, with the professor providing context for various puzzle objectives, such as instructing players to "blow up the fish tank with the missile"[^ref-13]. The game's narrator, voiced by Bill Barrett, guides players through tutorials and provides encouragement throughout their contraption-building journey[^ref-14]. Professor Tim's enthusiastic personality adds warmth to the experience, making players feel like they're genuinely contributing to important (if eccentric) scientific work. The premise successfully justifies increasingly bizarre objectives while maintaining the whimsical tone that defined the series since its 1992 inception.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The game utilizes a mouse-driven interface where players select from over 100 different mechanical parts to construct their contraptions[^ref-15]. The interface includes a help button that provides close-up views of parts for better understanding[^ref-16]. Players can drag and drop components including pulleys, conveyor belts, springs, dynamite, cats, mice, and various other objects onto a 2D playing field[^ref-17]. The physics simulation engine ensures deterministic behavior without random number generation, meaning identical setups will always produce the same results[^ref-18].

### Structure and Progression

The game is organized into five difficulty categories: Tutorial (50 levels), Easy, Medium, Hard, and Really Hard[^ref-19][^ref-8]. Players progress through increasingly complex challenges that test their understanding of physics and creative problem-solving abilities. The tutorial levels from the original game remain unchanged, but all other puzzles are new except for one slightly modified puzzle called "Mel-in-the-box"[^ref-19]. The game also includes 50 head-to-head puzzles designed for two-player competition[^ref-15].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Each puzzle presents players with a specific objective that must be accomplished using the available parts. As one reviewer explained, "Players must use a variety of mechanical components to create a Rube Goldberg like device that accomplishes a specific goal (such as popping a balloon)"[^ref-2]. The joy of the game lies in "making machines that work, not in chalking up high scores"[^ref-24]. The physics simulation accurately models interactions between objects, ambient effects like air pressure and gravity, creating realistic cause-and-effect chains[^ref-18][^ref-6].

The game features a diverse array of mechanical components including trampolines, scissors, conveyor belts, rocket engines, bowling balls, springs, and even live animals like cats, mice, and hamsters. Each component has specific physical properties that players must understand to create functioning contraptions. For example, cats chase mice, bowling balls roll and fall with realistic momentum, and rockets provide thrust in specific directions. The sandbox mode allows unlimited experimentation without puzzle constraints, enabling players to build wildly elaborate machines purely for entertainment.
