<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

The Incredible Toon Machine is a puzzle game released in 1994 by [[Sierra On-Line]], developed by [[Jeff Tunnell Productions]] with development work also handled by Presage Software Development Company for both the Windows and Macintosh versions.[^ref-1][^ref-2] The game serves as a sequel to Sid & Al's Incredible Toons (1993) and represents a cartoon-themed spin-off of The Incredible Machine series, combining logical puzzle-solving gameplay with wacky animated cartoons in what *Electronic Entertainment* described as "Rube Goldberg meets Wile E. Coyote."[^ref-3][^ref-4]

The game challenges players to complete a series of Rube Goldberg contraptions with crucial parts deliberately left out, using a selection of over 71 gadgets and cartoon-themed items.[^ref-5][^ref-6] While not considered an official part of The Incredible Machine series proper, it was created by designer Chris Cole as "essentially a cartoon version of the same concept."[^ref-7] The game featured 130 new puzzles and introduced a player-versus-player mode alongside the "Hometoons" level editor that allowed players to design their own puzzles.[^ref-6][^ref-8]

What distinguished The Incredible Toon Machine from its more realistic counterparts was the emphasis on cartoon physics and humorous animations. *Computer Gaming World* noted that "the difference in the Toon version is that the result is always some wild animation where the cute, but not cuddly, creatures get anvils on the head and singed by dragon fire in order to get a chuckle out of you."[^ref-8] The game was targeted at younger players aged 6 and up while still offering challenging puzzles that kept adults engaged.[^ref-10]

## Story Summary

The Incredible Toon Machine takes place in a cartoon world populated by anthropomorphic characters engaged in slapstick rivalries. The primary protagonists are Sid E. Mouse and Al E. Cat, whose relationship mirrors the classic Tom and Jerry dynamic—Al will chase and eat Sid whenever he has the chance, making their interactions a central mechanic of the puzzle design.[^ref-13][^ref-14] As one fan aptly described it, players essentially "create your own Tom and Jerry cartoon simulator."[^ref-15]

The cast of characters extends beyond the cat-and-mouse duo to include Eunice Elephant, Hildegard Hen, Cliff Ant, and Bik Dragon, each with their own unique behaviors and interactions within the puzzle machinery.[^ref-13][^ref-16] According to MobyGames, "Sid Mouse and Al E. Cat have probably never heard of Tom & Jerry, but they're just as single-minded: any means to hurt the adversary is a good one."[^ref-17]

Rather than following a traditional narrative structure, the game presents puzzles as cartoon productions, treating each level as a scene to be completed. The marketing tagline captured this theatrical approach: "When You Play The Incredible Toon Machine, You Give Life to Cartoons."[^ref-18] Players progress through increasingly challenging scenarios, witnessing "cats gag on hairballs or elephants sneezing their way through puzzle solutions."[^ref-8]

The game's premise drew from the rich tradition of cartoon physics established by animators of the early to mid-1900s, most notably Rube Goldberg, whose elaborate contraption drawings became the conceptual foundation for the entire Incredible Machine series.[^ref-19] The cartoon setting allowed for more fantastical elements including dragons, dynamite, and other items that would be out of place in the more grounded original series.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The Incredible Toon Machine operates as a single-player puzzle game utilizing a mouse-driven interface within the Windows 3.x environment.[^ref-5][^ref-20] The game presents a fixed 2D screen where players must arrange various objects and gadgets to achieve specific goals.[^ref-5] Players interact with the puzzle space by selecting items from their available inventory and placing them within the contraption, then activating the machine to observe the results.

The interface includes a tutorial section to familiarize players with the game mechanics and the unique behaviors of each part.[^ref-21] Most items can be flipped horizontally, with some offering vertical flipping as well, while special items like the Hat Pin can be rotated in any of four directions, allowing for precise placement.[^ref-13]

### Structure and Progression

The game features 130 puzzles organized into multiple difficulty tiers:[^ref-6][^ref-21]

- **Cake Walk:** Introductory puzzles for learning the basics
- **All Brawn No Brains:** Easy to moderate challenges
- **Really REALLY Hard:** Advanced puzzles requiring careful planning
- **LOONEY BIN!:** The most challenging puzzles in the game

The game was noted by experienced players as being "quite a bit HARDER than The Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions," with the difficulty curve providing a substantial challenge even for series veterans.[^ref-22] The Windows CD version added animated cut scenes and CD music tracks to enhance the presentation between puzzle sections.[^ref-13]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The core objective mirrors the broader Incredible Machine series: completing Rube Goldberg-type contraptions using a provided set of parts.[^ref-23] Players receive a selection of gadgets for each puzzle and must arrange them so that when the machine is activated, a chain reaction accomplishes the stated goal. The game includes a "Make A Machine" or "Hometoons" mode allowing players to design their own levels using all 71 available gadgets.[^ref-6][^ref-8]

The cartoon-themed parts behave according to exaggerated physics, with interactions including cheese luring Sid Mouse, anvils falling on characters' heads, dragons breathing fire, and elephants sneezing to propel objects.[^ref-8][^ref-17] Each puzzle has multiple possible solutions, encouraging creative thinking and experimentation.[^ref-11]

Copy protection was implemented through a password system requiring players to reference the manual.[^ref-21] Additionally, players could enter the password "WIND" to unlock secret puzzles not available through normal progression.[^ref-24]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

*Electronic Entertainment* awarded the predecessor Sid & Al's Incredible Toons a score of 80/100, with reviewer Wayne Kawamoto praising the game's combination of "logical game play of The Incredible Machine with wacky animated cartoons."[^ref-3][^ref-4] *Computer Gaming World* was equally enthusiastic, describing it as "exactly what I wanted from a sequel to The Incredible Machine, with more challenging puzzles, hysterically funny animation and sound," and noted it was "a difficult game to describe because it moves beyond the boundaries of the genre into a new generation of software toys."[^ref-3][^ref-4]

*The Boston Globe* reviewer Adam Baratz gave The Incredible Toon Machine a score of 4 out of 5 stars in his June 5, 1995 review.[^ref-12] The German gaming press was particularly enthusiastic, with *Wiz* magazine awarding 90 points, while both *PC Games (Germany)* and *Power Play* gave scores of 89.[^ref-4] *Power Play* would later name Sid & Al's Incredible Toons as the Best Puzzle Game of 1994.[^ref-17]

The predecessor game was runner-up for *Computer Gaming World's* Strategy Game of the Year in 1994, demonstrating the series' strong critical standing.[^ref-3][^ref-4] The magazine would later rank it #12 in their "Funniest Computer Game" list in November 1996.[^ref-17]

### Modern Assessment

Games Nostalgia describes The Incredible Machine series as "one of the most original puzzle games ever created for personal computers," praising its ability to teach physics principles while encouraging critical thinking and creativity.[^ref-25] The Home of the Underdogs noted that [[Jeff Tunnell]] "catapulted the already addictive concept of The Incredible Machines into a whole new levels by injecting two hapless cartoon characters, a greedy cat a hungry mouse, as both puzzle pieces and colorful protagonists."[^ref-26]

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** 93% (Critics)[^ref-1]
- **Sid & Al's Incredible Toons (MobyGames):** 82% (Critics)[^ref-17]
- **MyAbandonware:** 4.46/5 (HOTUD rating)[^ref-26]
- **GamePressure:** 7.2 (User Rating)[^ref-10]
- **I ❤ Old Games:** 62/100[^ref-27]

## Development

### Origins

The Incredible Toon Machine emerged from [[Jeff Tunnell]]'s desire to continue innovating within the puzzle game genre he had helped establish. After leaving Dynamix in 1991, Tunnell founded Jeff Tunnell Productions with the goal of returning to "the guerrilla model of game development" that would allow for more experimental concepts.[^ref-11][^ref-28] The concept for cartoon-themed puzzle games had been inspired by Rube Goldberg's cartoons from the early to mid-1900s, as well as the Pinball Construction Set and the Mouse Trap board game.[^ref-11][^ref-19]

The original The Incredible Machine (1992) was conceived by Tunnell and Slye as early as 1983, but the technology and market weren't ready for such a title until the early 1990s.[^ref-11] The success of the original game and its expansion, The Even More Incredible Machine (1993), led to the spin-off concept that would become Sid & Al's Incredible Toons, which was then updated and expanded into The Incredible Toon Machine.

### Production

The Incredible Toon Machine was developed by Jeff Tunnell Productions with Presage Software Development Company handling the programming for both the Macintosh and Windows versions.[^ref-2] The game built upon the foundation of Sid & Al's Incredible Toons, adding 30 additional puzzles (for a total of 130), a player-versus-player competitive mode, and the "Hometoons" level design feature.[^ref-6][^ref-8]

The development team included designers Chris Cole and Brian Hahn working alongside Jeffrey Tunnell, with the game being published under the Sierra Discovery Series label.[^ref-1][^ref-28] The project represented a collaboration between Jeff Tunnell Productions and Sierra On-Line's educational gaming division.

The game's physics simulator engine allowed for complex chain-reaction puzzles with multiple possible solutions.[^ref-11] The Windows CD version introduced animated cut scenes and enhanced CD audio tracks featuring arrangements of classical music.[^ref-13][^ref-12] The soundtrack included works by renowned classical composers: Johann Sebastian Bach, Johann Strauss II, Jacques Offenbach, Gioachino Rossini, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Johannes Brahms.[^ref-12]

The game featured 21 distinct sound clips and music tracks, with the complete soundtrack totaling 45 minutes and 55 seconds of audio content.[^ref-29] The cartoon animations were noted for their entertainment value, with MobyGames observing that "the Toons adds a whole range of in-puzzle animations that increase the entertainment value of this release."[^ref-1]

Voice work was limited compared to other Sierra titles of the era, with the emphasis placed on sound effects and musical accompaniment rather than extensive voice acting.[^ref-34]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

The Incredible Machine series proved to be one of Sierra On-Line's most enduring franchises, spawning numerous sequels and spin-offs throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.[^ref-35] The series rights were later acquired by Disney Interactive before eventually being picked up by PushButton Labs, co-founded by Jeff Tunnell, in October 2009.[^ref-19]

### Collections

The Incredible Toon Machine was included as part of the broader Incredible Machine franchise catalog, though it did not appear in the major compilation releases that featured the numbered entries. The original The Incredible Machine was recognized in *Computer Gaming World's* "150 Best Games of All Time" list at #62 in 1996 and was inducted into the magazine's Hall of Fame in 2006.[^ref-23] It also appeared in the book "1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die."[^ref-23]

### Fan Projects

In 2014, a spiritual successor titled Contraption Maker was released by Spotkin, a studio founded by former Incredible Machine developers, continuing the legacy of Rube Goldberg-style puzzle games.[^ref-35] The original games remain available through abandonware preservation sites and game archiving services like the Internet Archive.[^ref-13]

### Critical Perspective

The Incredible Toon Machine occupies an interesting position in adventure gaming history as a bridge between the educational puzzle games of the early 1990s and the more sophisticated physics-based puzzle games that would emerge in later years. Its emphasis on cartoon physics and humorous animations helped make complex problem-solving accessible to younger audiences while maintaining enough challenge to engage adult players.

The game demonstrated that the Rube Goldberg puzzle concept could be successfully adapted to different visual styles and thematic frameworks. While not as commercially prominent as the numbered Incredible Machine entries, The Incredible Toon Machine helped establish the viability of spin-offs and thematic variations within successful game franchises—a business model that would become increasingly common in the industry.
