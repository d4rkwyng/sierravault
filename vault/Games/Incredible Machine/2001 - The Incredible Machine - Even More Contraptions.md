<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions is a puzzle game released in 2001, serving as the eighth and final installment in the beloved Incredible Machine series.[^ref-1] Developed by [[Dynamix]] and published by [[Sierra On-Line]], the game builds upon the legacy of its predecessors by offering players 250 brand-new puzzles that challenge them to construct elaborate Rube Goldberg-style contraptions.[^ref-2] The objective remains consistent with the series' core concept: arrange a given collection of objects in needlessly complex fashion to perform simple tasks such as getting a character home safely, catching a cat in a basket, or lighting fireworks with a laser beam.[^ref-3]

The game functions as a direct continuation of Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions released a year earlier, featuring identical gameplay mechanics while providing substantially more content and increased difficulty.[^ref-4] Players can choose to solve the 250 included puzzles or create their own contraptions using a comprehensive construction set, with the ability to swap puzzles with other players over the Internet through the WonSwap service.[^ref-2] The award-winning legacy of the series continued with this installment, which combined improved head-to-head multiplayer modes and an updated easy-to-use interface.[^ref-2]

Although the game applies properties of physics to problem solving, it is so delightfully entertaining that gamers of all ages won't realize the depth of learning involved.[^ref-5] The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions represents a vintage blend of educational and entertainment software at their finest, making it particularly appealing to families and educators seeking engaging content for children.[^ref-6]

## Story Summary

The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions does not feature a traditional narrative storyline. Instead, the game presents players with a series of self-contained puzzle scenarios, each featuring its own objectives and challenges.[^ref-6] Players interact with a quirky Professor character who serves as an in-game guide and mentor, providing instructions and hints for each puzzle through both readable text and voiced narration.[^ref-6]

Each puzzle presents a unique scenario with specific goals that must be accomplished. Tasks range from simple objectives like getting Mel home safely to more complex challenges such as blowing up fish tanks with missiles or lighting fireworks using laser beams and chain reactions.[^ref-8] The Professor's humorous commentary accompanies each puzzle, with memorable phrases like "Wipe that puzzled look off your face. It's just a game, mon!" adding personality to the experience.[^ref-9]

The scenarios span a variety of whimsical situations that incorporate household objects, animals, and fantastical elements. Players might need to build monkey or mouse-powered machines, use lasers and fire fireworks, or start fires using a bowling ball and flint.[^ref-10] The absence of a connected narrative allows each puzzle to stand alone as its own mini-story, creating hundreds of unique problem-solving situations.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions features a point-and-click interface with keyboard and mouse controls.[^ref-1] The game operates in a paused state during construction, allowing players to carefully place objects in the environment before running the simulation to observe the results.[^ref-10] Players select parts from their available inventory and drag them onto the playing field, rotating and positioning them precisely to achieve the desired outcome.

The interface was updated from previous installments to be more user-friendly and intuitive.[^ref-2] In freeform mode, parts are split into categories to help players quickly locate the components they need.[^ref-11] Every part includes a help button that displays a close-up view along with an explanation of how it works, making the game accessible to newcomers while maintaining depth for experienced players.[^ref-11]

### Structure and Progression

The game contains 250 puzzles organized across multiple difficulty levels:[^ref-1]

- **Tutorial:** 50 introductory puzzles teaching game mechanics (identical to Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions)[^ref-1]
- **Easy:** Straightforward puzzles introducing basic concepts
- **Medium:** Moderately challenging scenarios requiring more complex solutions
- **Difficult:** Advanced puzzles with no hints provided[^ref-9]
- **Expert:** The most challenging puzzles demanding precise placement and creative thinking
- **Two Player:** 50 competitive head-to-head puzzles[^ref-12]

The biggest difference from its predecessor is that this game is considerably harder than Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions.[^ref-13] All Difficult levels have no hints in the sequel, unlike in the original game.[^ref-9] Speedrunners have completed all difficulty levels in approximately 4 hours and 19 minutes for the "Doctor of Contrapology" challenge, which requires completing every puzzle.[^ref-14]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The core gameplay involves constructing Rube Goldberg-type contraptions using over 100 different machine parts.[^ref-12] These components range from simple tools to complex mechanisms, including:[^ref-15]

- Basic objects: levers, pulleys, ropes, balls, and ramps
- Power sources: candles, motors, generators, and lasers
- Animals: cats, mice, monkeys, and other creatures that interact with the environment
- Specialty items: anti-gravity pads, cannons, trampolines, and conveyor belts
- Environmental elements: cheese, balloons, dynamite, and fireworks

The game gives players a surprising amount of freedom by offering multiple solutions to puzzles.[^ref-16] This open-ended design encourages creativity and experimentation, allowing players to discover unconventional approaches to problems. The physics simulation is deterministic with no random number generator, ensuring that identical setups produce identical results every time.[^ref-3]

The Professor provides puzzle goals that can be read or listened to, offering accessibility for younger players.[^ref-17] Sometimes solutions require making sure every single thing is in exactly the right place, demanding precision and patience from players.[^ref-18]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions received generally positive reviews upon release, with critics praising its puzzle design while noting it was largely an expansion of the previous game's formula.

GameSpot awarded the game 7.6 out of 10, with reviewer Trey Walker noting that "Like its predecessor, Even More Contraptions is an excellent puzzle game that is sure to please amateur inventors and puzzle game fans alike."[^ref-19] He acknowledged that "The problems in the game are only minor, and they do not detract from the overall experience and the high quality of the puzzles."[^ref-19]

IGN gave Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions (the immediate predecessor) 8.4 out of 10, with Martin Reyes calling it "a vintage blend of educational and entertainment software at their finest."[^ref-6] He praised the educational value, stating "It's a scientific fact: kids can't run out of energy" in reference to the game's ability to engage young players.[^ref-6]

All Game Guide awarded the game a score of 90, praising how "the game applies properties of physics to problem solving" while being "so delightfully entertaining that gamers of all ages won't realize the depth of learning involved."[^ref-5]

GameZone described it as "a wonderful program that will challenge players to use their brains in ways that involve both logic and creativity."[^ref-5]

Children's Software Revue (2001) provided a glowing endorsement, stating "Our testers, who ranged in age from seven to 43, all loved the program."[^ref-2]

Absolute Games (Russia) gave Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions 80%, with reviewer Vyacheslav Golovanov recommending: "If you prefer developing brain muscles rather than finger muscles - try TIM4. You'll like it, I assure you."[^ref-20]

### Modern Assessment

The Contraptions series (2000–2001), including both Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions and Even More Contraptions, received mixed reviews averaging around 7/10.[^ref-7] Critics praised the shift to 3D visuals and enhanced edutainment value but offered criticism for occasionally dated physics simulations and less intuitive controls compared to the 2D originals.[^ref-7]

Hardcore Gaming 101's retrospective noted that "After the long wait between The Incredible Machine 2/3, ROTIM's a bit of a disappointment" while acknowledging that "Even More Contraptions is pretty much an expansion pack to ROTIM, but except for the first 50 tutorial puzzles from the original, the puzzles are brand-new."[^ref-11]

User reviews remain enthusiastic decades after release. One reviewer on GameSpot declared "This is one of my all-time favorite PC games. This is a classic series done even better."[^ref-19] Many players fondly remember the game from their childhood, with comments like "This game was my LIFE as a kid" and "I Loved this game as a kid, me and a friend both had a copy at one time, the two of us would spend hours putting together intricate contraptions."[^ref-22]

**Aggregate Scores:**

- **RAWG:** Rated "Exceptional"[^ref-24]

## Development

### Origins

The Incredible Machine series originated in 1992 as a collaboration between designer [[Kevin Ryan]] and [[Jeff Tunnell]]'s team at Dynamix.[^ref-15] With a modest budget of $36,000, the team managed to create a game that felt like a physics experiment wrapped in a fun, puzzle-driven package.[^ref-15] Inspired by the works of Rube Goldberg, the cartoonist famous for depicting absurdly complicated machines performing simple tasks, the series would go on to spawn seven more titles over nine years.[^ref-9]

Even More Contraptions emerged as a direct continuation of Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions, released just a year earlier in 2000.[^ref-4] The development team sought to capitalize on the revived interest in the franchise by providing substantially more content while maintaining the core gameplay that fans loved. Kevin Ryan, who had been designing and programming games for almost five decades by the 2010s, remained instrumental in defining the series' puzzle philosophy.[^ref-25]

### Production

The game was developed by Dynamix, Inc. under the Sierra On-Line umbrella.[^ref-1] While the core gameplay remained identical to Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions, the development team focused on creating 200 brand-new puzzles to supplement the 50 tutorial levels carried over from the previous game.[^ref-1]

The production incorporated music from earlier Incredible Machine versions, creating a sense of continuity with the series' history.[^ref-1] Most tracks remained the same as the previous game, but new compositions were added for this installment, including a few tracks from the very first The Incredible Machine game.[^ref-26]

**Development Credits:**[^ref-1]
- **Design:** Brian Hahn, Neil Witkin, Jared W. Eden, Richard Tunnell, Garrett Turner
- **Original Series Designer:** Kevin Ryan[^ref-15]
- **Producer Team:** Jeff Tunnell Productions (original series)[^ref-1]

### Technical Achievements

The Contraptions series marked a significant visual upgrade for the franchise, with parts now rendered in 3D rather than the 2D sprites of earlier installments.[^ref-11] The game utilized a DirectDraw API for graphics rendering, supporting 800x600 resolution in 32-bit color.[^ref-27]

The physics engine remained deterministic, ensuring consistent puzzle solutions across all playthroughs.[^ref-3] This technical decision was crucial for a puzzle game where players needed to refine their solutions through iteration—knowing that the same setup would always produce the same result was essential for the gameplay loop.

The game introduced the WonSwap service, allowing players to share homemade puzzles over the Internet—an innovative feature for its time that extended the game's longevity through user-generated content.[^ref-3]

### Critical Perspective

The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions represents both the culmination and conclusion of one of gaming's most beloved educational puzzle franchises. Its family-friendly quality led to widespread popularity in homes and schools alike, introducing countless children to basic physics concepts through engaging, hands-on experimentation.[^ref-9]

The game's design philosophy of offering multiple solutions to each puzzle fostered creativity and critical thinking, distinguishing it from more rigid puzzle games of the era.[^ref-16] While critics noted that the Contraptions series felt somewhat dated compared to the innovative 2D originals, the core gameplay loop remained compelling enough to earn strong reviews and passionate fan devotion.[^ref-7]

The series' influence can be seen in numerous physics-based puzzle games that followed, from Crazy Machines to the mobile hit Cut the Rope. The fact that original creator Kevin Ryan returned to develop Contraption Maker decades later speaks to the enduring appeal of the Rube Goldberg puzzle concept. As one reviewer noted, the game excels at challenging players to develop "brain muscles rather than finger muscles"—a design philosophy that remains relevant in an era increasingly concerned with meaningful educational gaming.[^ref-20]
