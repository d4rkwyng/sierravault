# SCP - Sierra Conversion Project

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 5, 2026</small>

## Overview

The Sierra Conversion Project (SCP) is a Spanish fan group dedicated to preserving and enhancing Sierra adventure games on the Commodore Amiga platform.[^ref-1] Originally focused on translating and preserving Amiga games in Spanish, the group expanded their mission after discovering that Sierra's original Amiga ports suffered from poor graphics quality compared to their DOS counterparts.[^ref-2]

Led by key members DaRaSCo and kikems (of AmigaWave), the SCP has developed techniques to extract, modify, and re-inject improved graphics back into Sierra's SCI engine games.[^ref-2] Their work addresses a long-standing frustration in the retro gaming community—Sierra's Amiga ports were widely considered among the worst conversions of the era, with fans describing the original Space Quest IV Amiga version as causing them to "vomit at the non-amiga-worthy graphics" and "swear at the arrogance of Sierra for releasing a daft excuse for a port."[^ref-3]

The project gained significant attention in January 2026 with the rapid release of three enhanced games: [[1991 - Police Quest III - The Kindred|Police Quest III]] (January 3), [[1990 - King's Quest V - Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder|King's Quest V]] (January 4), and [[1991 - Space Quest IV - Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers|Space Quest IV]] (January 15).[^ref-1][^ref-4][^ref-5]

## Released Projects

### Police Quest III Enhancement (January 3, 2026)

The first SCP project to be completed with all graphics improved and tested to completion, [[1991 - Police Quest III - The Kindred|Police Quest III: The Kindred]] represents a milestone for the group.[^ref-2] Graphics were modified by kikems with assistance from DaRaSCo using Amiga-native tools including ImageFX, PPaint, and Adpro.[^ref-2]

As Estrayk noted: "Yes, kikems used Amiga tools to prove that Sierra didn't do better in those years because they didn't want to, not because the tools didn't exist."[^ref-2]

### King's Quest V OCS Remaster (January 4, 2026)

A collaborative effort between kikems/AmigaWave and DaRaSCo, this remaster brings [[1990 - King's Quest V - Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder|King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder]] closer to the PC VGA version's visual quality.[^ref-4] The enhancement improves the graphics that Sierra's original Amiga conversion poorly translated from the DOS original.

Like the other SCP enhancements, the King's Quest V remaster includes MIDI support via Roland MT-32/mt32-pi.[^ref-4]

### Space Quest IV OCS Enhanced (January 15, 2026)

The third SCP release reconstructs the palette and graphics of [[1991 - Space Quest IV - Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers|Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers]] for Amiga OCS.[^ref-3] The original Amiga port was notorious for its poor color palette—a limitation of Sierra's SCI engine implementation for Amiga which used a single palette for the entire adventure.[^ref-3]

DaRaSCo spent considerable time finding a more consistent palette that works across all game screens while maintaining the spirit of the original DOS VGA graphics.[^ref-3] The enhancement also includes MIDI support via Roland MT-32.[^ref-3]

## Projects in Development

| Game | Progress | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **[[1991 - Conquests of the Longbow - The Legend of Robin Hood\|Conquests of the Longbow]]** | 90% | Near completion[^ref-2] |
| **Space Quest IV** (Full Remaster) | 75% | Extended enhancement beyond initial release[^ref-2] |

## Technical Approach

### The Problem with Sierra's Amiga Ports

Sierra's SCI engine ports to Amiga were hampered by technical decisions that resulted in inferior visual presentation compared to DOS versions:[^ref-3]

- **Single Palette Limitation:** The Amiga SCI engine used one color palette for the entire game, unlike DOS which could use different palettes per screen
- **Color Reduction:** VGA's 256-color graphics were poorly adapted to Amiga's hardware capabilities
- **Lack of Optimization:** Sierra appeared to invest minimal effort in proper Amiga conversions

### SCP's Enhancement Process

The SCP team developed a workflow to address these issues:[^ref-2]

1. **Extraction:** Graphics are extracted from the original Amiga game files
2. **Enhancement:** Artists manually improve colors, palettes, and details using Amiga-native tools
3. **Re-injection:** Modified graphics are reintegrated into the SCI engine game files
4. **Testing:** Each game is playtested to completion to ensure modifications don't cause engine errors

### Tools Used

Notably, all graphics work is performed using period-appropriate Amiga software:[^ref-2]
- **ImageFX** - Professional image processing
- **PPaint** - Personal Paint for pixel art
- **Adpro** - Art Department Professional for batch processing

This proves Sierra could have achieved similar results in the early 1990s had they chosen to invest the effort.

## Community Response

The SCP's work has been enthusiastically received by the retro gaming community. IndieRetroNews coverage of the Space Quest IV release noted that the enhancement makes "the infamously bad Amiga port actually playable."[^ref-3]

The Sierra Gaming World Facebook group has been instrumental in spreading awareness of SCP releases, connecting the Spanish-based team with the broader international Sierra fan community.[^ref-3]

## Legacy

The Sierra Conversion Project represents a unique approach to fan preservation—rather than creating VGA remakes from scratch like [[Infamous Adventures]] or [[AGD Interactive]], SCP focuses on rehabilitating Sierra's existing but flawed Amiga ports. This preserves the original game code and structure while addressing the visual shortcomings that made these versions unplayable for many fans.

Their work also serves as historical documentation, demonstrating that the tools and techniques needed for quality Amiga ports existed in Sierra's era. The poor quality of the original conversions reflects business decisions rather than technical limitations.
