<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 31, 2026</small>

## Overview

**Front Page Sports: Ski Racing** is a 1997 skiing simulation game developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra On-Line[^ref-1]. The game simulates the four World Cup skiing variants: Slalom, Giant Slalom, Super Giant Slalom and Downhill, focusing on realistic gameplay rather than arcade-style action[^ref-2]. Olympic medalist Picabo Street served as the game's featured athlete and skiing consultant, providing video tips and training instruction throughout the game[^ref-3].

Unlike the snowboarding games popular on console systems at the time, Front Page Sports: Ski Racing was designed as "a racing simulation through and through"[^ref-4]. The game featured six courses based on real-world locations: four American and two European ski resorts, all fully rendered in 3D using Dynamix's new 3-D engine[^ref-5][^ref-5]. Players could compete in single races, multiple events, or participate in full season racing across various difficulty levels[^ref-5].

## Story Summary

Front Page Sports: Ski Racing does not feature a traditional narrative story, but rather focuses on career progression in the world of competitive skiing[^ref-6]. Players work their way through the skiing ranks, competing in various World Cup events while learning from Olympic medalist Picabo Street, who appears in training videos explaining "the best and easiest way to make it down the hill alive"[^ref-1]. The game emphasizes the real-world aspects of professional ski racing, including the courage required "to put two boards on your feet and rush down a mountain at speeds of up to 90 mph"[^ref-7].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The game supports both keyboard and mouse input, with additional compatibility for Microsoft Sidewinder and Force Feedback joysticks[^ref-5]. Players can choose from two camera perspectives: first-person and behind-the-skier views[^ref-5]. The interface includes 3D card support and adjustable view distance settings to optimize performance on different hardware configurations[^ref-5]. The force feedback support was a notable feature for the era, providing tactile responses as players navigated different terrain types.

### Structure and Progression

Players can select from five skiing events: slalom, giant slalom, Super G, downhill, and all-around competitions[^ref-8]. The game simulates "the four World Cup skiing variants: Slalom, Giant Slalom, Super Giant Slalom and Downhill," focusing on realistic gameplay where "there are more maneuvers necessary than just steering the skis in the right direction"[^ref-2]. The game offers three difficulty levels - Rookie, Pro, and Champion - with the Rookie level featuring 13 gates per race[^ref-5].

Competition takes place across six different, fully rendered world-class resorts: four American and two European locations[^ref-5]. The game includes a "Train with Picabo" mode where players can practice on all mountains and events under the guidance of Olympic medalist Picabo Street, who provides video tips "explaining the best and easiest way to make it down the hill alive"[^ref-1]. Results and statistics are not recorded in this training mode, allowing consequence-free experimentation[^ref-6].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The skiing mechanics require precise control and practice, as the game focuses on realistic physics rather than arcade-style gameplay[^ref-5]. Players must navigate through gates while managing speed and maintaining control on varied terrain. The game was described as a "fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping downhill ski simulation" that demanded concentration and skill[^ref-3]. One reviewer admitted that "of all the games I've played recently, this one was the hardest"[^ref-7], highlighting the steep learning curve.

Each race venue features calculated penalties that reflect the difficulty of the course, length, and overall level of competition[^ref-9]. Missing gates or crashing resulted in time penalties that could devastate an otherwise clean run. The game also includes skiing tricks, though reviewers noted they had "no practical use for them"[^ref-5] beyond visual flair—a design choice that puzzled some players.

The courage and skill required mirrors real-world skiing, with the game acknowledging that players must be willing "to put two boards on your feet and rush down a mountain at speeds of up to 90 mph"[^ref-7]. This commitment to realism over accessibility would prove both the game's greatest strength and its most significant barrier to mainstream adoption.

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| GameSpot | 8/10 | "Great" rating, praised graphics and sound[^ref-10] |
| Gamezilla | 75% | "One of the best sports sims available" graphically[^ref-7] |
| PC Player | 62% | Mixed reception from German gaming press[^ref-1] |
| PC Joker | 33% | Poor reception from German gaming press[^ref-1] |
| GameStar | 28% | Very negative review from German gaming press[^ref-1] |
| Computer Gaming World | 2/5 | "Moderately fun arcade racing game"[^ref-1] |
| Computer Games Magazine | 2/5 | Negative review[^ref-1] |

The stark disparity in critical reception highlighted the game's divisive nature. GameSpot's Tasos Kaiafas praised the simulation approach while acknowledging its limitations: "Though the graphics are impressive and the sound effects are inspiring, FrontPage Sports: Ski Racing falls a split-second short of a gold medal run"[^ref-10]. The review noted that the game required genuine skill and practice, with one reviewer admitting that "of all the games I've played recently, this one was the hardest"[^ref-7].

German gaming publications were notably harsher in their assessments, with GameStar's 28% and PC Joker's 33% reflecting significant dissatisfaction. This regional variation in reception may have reflected different expectations between North American and European audiences regarding skiing simulation games.

### Modern Assessment

The game maintains an aggregate critics score of 56% on MobyGames[^ref-5]. User ratings on various platforms show mixed results, with GameFAQs users rating it as "Outstanding" based on 4 ratings[^ref-11], while other sites show ratings ranging from 3.8/5 to 5/5[^ref-3][^ref-12]. Modern reviewers have noted it as "the best ski racing game on PC at the time"[^ref-5] despite its limited course environments and technical issues.

The game has developed a small but dedicated following in the speedrunning community, with active leaderboards maintained despite the small player base[^ref-5]. This suggests that for players who mastered its challenging control scheme, the game offered replayable competitive experiences that have stood the test of time.

## Development

### Origins

Front Page Sports: Ski Racing was developed as part of Sierra's Front Page Sports series, which focused on realistic sports simulations[^ref-5]. The game was designed with world champion skier Picabo Street serving as a consultant, lending authenticity to the skiing mechanics and techniques[^ref-5]. Street, an Olympic medalist, served as "host, guide and teacher" throughout the game, appearing in video tips and training instruction segments[^ref-7]. Scott Youngblood, a veteran of the Front Page Sports Football series, served as the game's designer[^ref-5].

As Gamezilla noted, skiing games were "something of a rarity on the PC"[^ref-13], giving Front Page Sports: Ski Racing an unusual niche in the market. The game was positioned as a serious simulation alternative to the arcade-style snowboarding games popular on console systems at the time, with GameSpot emphasizing it was "a racing simulation through and through"[^ref-4].

### Production

The development was handled by Dynamix using their new 3-D engine[^ref-5]. Unfortunately, the game was rushed for Christmas 1997 release, resulting in many planned features being cut from the final product[^ref-5]. Computer Gaming World's Loyd Case would later criticize the results, suggesting "Maybe if Papyrus had developed the game instead of Dynamix it would have been more realistic. As it is, it's a moderately fun arcade racing game"[^ref-1].

Sierra had a patch in development following release but would not comment on its contents or release date at the time[^ref-5]. The game supported 3D acceleration cards, including advertised support for Rendition and 3Dfx graphics cards[^ref-5]. However, this promise would become a source of controversy among players.

### Technical Achievements

The game featured impressive 3D graphics for its time, with reviewers noting it was "graphically one of the best sports sims available"[^ref-7]. The six courses were "fully rendered in 3D" using Dynamix's new engine, showcasing real-world ski resort locations[^ref-5]. GameSpot praised the graphics and sound effects as "impressive" and "inspiring"[^ref-10].

However, the advertised support for Rendition graphics acceleration cards was never actually implemented, despite being promised on the retail box. After two patches stating "Sierra Screamin' 3D (Rendition V1000) support is not included in this update," Rendition cards were never actually supported[^ref-5]. This broken promise left some customers frustrated with their purchases.

The game required a Pentium 90 processor, 16 MB RAM, 4X CD-ROM drive, and 75 MB of hard drive space plus 50 MB free after installation[^ref-5]. It supported Microsoft Sidewinder and Force Feedback joysticks for enhanced control[^ref-5].

### Version History

| Version | Year | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| 1.0 | 1997 | Original release for Christmas season[^ref-5] |
| 1.1 | 1998 | First patch (Rendition support still missing)[^ref-5] |
| 1.2 | 1998 | Second patch, still no Rendition support[^ref-5] |
| Skiing 1999 Edition | 1999 | Repackaged version by Sierra Sports[^ref-5] |
| "Ski Racing" | 2000 | Simplified retail rebranding[^ref-5] |
| Community Patch | 2020+ | Fixes date limitation for modern systems[^ref-14] |

## Legacy

Front Page Sports: Ski Racing was followed by "Skiing, 1999 Edition" and was later repackaged by Sierra Sports as simply "Ski Racing"[^ref-5][^ref-5]. The game filled a niche in PC gaming, as "skiing games are something of a rarity on the PC"[^ref-13]. Despite its technical issues and rushed release, it represented an ambitious attempt to bring realistic skiing simulation to home computers. The game has since been preserved by various abandonware sites and the Internet Archive, allowing modern players to experience this unique entry in Sierra's sports simulation catalog[^ref-2][^ref-20]. The game is documented across gaming databases including IGDB[^ref-18] and Giant Bomb[^ref-19], reflecting its place in Sierra's sports gaming history[^ref-17]. Dynamix's development work on the title demonstrated the studio's versatility beyond their adventure game roots[^ref-16]. PCGamingWiki maintains technical compatibility guides for modern systems[^ref-15].

A community-created patch has been developed to address compatibility issues, specifically fixing "a superficial limitation preventing the game from running on a computer with its date set to 2020 and beyond"[^ref-14].
