# Front Page Sports Golf Tour Course Add On

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 27, 2026</small>

## Overview

Front Page Sports Golf Tour Course Add On was a series of expansion packs released for Front Page Sports: Golf, Sierra On-Line's ambitious golf simulation that launched on May 16, 1997 for Microsoft Windows[^ref-1]. The add-on courses extended the base game's content by providing additional meticulously recreated real-world golf courses, allowing players to experience new challenges within the acclaimed TrueSwing golf engine[^ref-1]. The base game itself represented Sierra's answer to the dominant Links franchise, and was developed by Headgate Studios Inc. under the leadership of Vance Cook, who had previously served as director and lead programmer for Links and Links 386 Pro[^ref-2][^ref-11][^ref-12].

The Tour Course Add On series expanded the virtual golfing experience with several notable real-world courses including Pasatiempo Golf Club (Vol.1 no.2), Coeur D'Alene (Vol.1 no.3), and Black Diamond Ranche (Vol.1 no.4)[^ref-3]. These expansion courses were designed using the same rigorous methodology as the base game, which involved the design team visiting actual courses to capture video footage and hundreds of photographs, with planes flown over courses to obtain aerial photographs for accuracy[^ref-1]. Information about these add-on courses has become quite hard to come by in the modern era, making them somewhat obscure collector's items[^ref-3].

The base Front Page Sports: Golf was described as "a gem of a golf sim" by Game Revolution and praised by Computer Gaming World as "worth the wait"[^ref-1]. The game's revolutionary TrueSwing interface, which would later be implemented in PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition, set a new standard for golf game controls[^ref-1][^ref-4]. The Tour Course Add On packages allowed enthusiasts to further explore this innovative control system across diverse golfing environments.

## Course Content

### Available Add-On Courses

The Front Page Sports Golf Tour Course Add On series was released as a numbered volume system, with each volume containing a different real-world course recreation[^ref-3]:

- **Vol.1 no.1:** The main base game
- **Vol.1 no.2:** Pasatiempo Golf Club Add-on
- **Vol.1 no.3:** Coeur D'Alene add-on course
- **Vol.1 no.4:** Black Diamond Ranche add-on course

Each add-on course was created using the same detailed photographic and videographic process employed for the original game's courses[^ref-1]. The design team's commitment to authenticity extended to every element of course recreation, from terrain modeling to environmental details[^ref-1].

### Course Design Philosophy

The courses in Front Page Sports: Golf and its add-ons carried a more municipal course feel compared to competitors, providing a distinct atmosphere that differentiated the game from other golf simulations of the era[^ref-2]. This design choice gave the game series a more accessible, everyman quality while maintaining the technical precision that serious golf simulation enthusiasts demanded[^ref-2].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The Tour Course Add On utilized the same revolutionary TrueSwing mouse-controlled swing system that defined the base game[^ref-1][^ref-4]. While SimGolf was technically the first golf game to introduce a mouse-controlled swing method, TrueSwing was considered superior and became the defining feature of Front Page Sports: Golf[^ref-1]. The system allowed players to control every aspect of their swing through intuitive mouse movements, creating what reviewers described as gameplay that "just feels like golf in a way that no other golf sim duplicates"[^ref-1].

The game featured a three-click swing system as an alternative control method[^ref-5], providing accessibility for players who preferred traditional golf game controls. The interface supported resolutions up to 1024x768 with 64,000 colors, delivering impressive SVGA graphics for the era[^ref-6][^ref-5]. One notable feature included the golfer character falling on their rear end if the player shook the mouse during the swing animation[^ref-6].

### Structure and Progression

Players could experience the add-on courses through various game modes including single rounds, tournaments, and career play[^ref-4]. The golfer characters were rendered using texture-mapped polygons—a fully rendered 3-D approach that distinguished the game from competitors using superimposed FMV golfers[^ref-1][^ref-6]. This technical choice allowed for more dynamic camera angles and realistic player animations across all course environments.

### Multiplayer Features

The game featured connectivity through Sierra Internet Gaming System (SIGS), which was cutting-edge for 1997[^ref-5]. Notably, the multiplayer aspect was not initially planned and was implemented late in the base game's development cycle[^ref-1]. The smooth multiplayer integration remained impressive by retro standards and allowed players to compete on add-on courses with friends online[^ref-5].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Front Page Sports: Golf received positive reviews upon release, with critics praising its innovative control system and realistic golf simulation[^ref-1].

**GameSpot** awarded the game **8.1/10**, with reviewer Tasos Kaiafas noting that "Front Page Sports: Golf certainly has some fun surprises, taking the stuffiness out of your typical golf sim"[^ref-1][^ref-6]. Kaiafas further observed that "without the TrueSwing, FPS: Golf would be little more than another golf sim with a few minor, yet entertaining, twists"[^ref-6].

**GameRevolution** gave the game an **A−** rating in July 1997, calling it "a gem of a golf sim"[^ref-1].

**Gamecenter** scored the game **8/10** on July 8, 1997, with reviewer Gordon Goble providing favorable coverage[^ref-1].

**Computer Gaming World** reviewer Scott A. May declared the game "worth the wait," acknowledging the extensive development period[^ref-1].

**Computer Games Strategy Plus** featured Jeff Lackey's enthusiastic review describing the game as "a very pleasant surprise and a true breakthrough" that "just feels like golf in a way that no other golf sim duplicates"[^ref-1].

**InterAction Magazine** featured John Zhaski calling it "the most playable and realistic golf game available for the PC"[^ref-1].

**PC Magazine** offered a more tempered assessment, with T. Liam McDonald writing that the game "leaves too many shots short"[^ref-1].

### Modern Assessment

The game has maintained a dedicated fanbase among retro gaming enthusiasts[^ref-4][^ref-3][^ref-8]. Modern retrospective reviews have acknowledged its historical significance in establishing control schemes that became industry standards[^ref-4][^ref-9].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames Critics Average:** 74%[^ref-4]
- **MyAbandonware User Rating:** 5/5 (4 votes)[^ref-7]
- **Retro Replay:** 7/10[^ref-5]

User reviews on MobyGames have been particularly enthusiastic, with one reviewer declaring it "My favourite golf game of the 90s. Was not topped until late into the Links series. Absolutely amazing game that does not get the respect it deserves"[^ref-4]. Another fan described it as "hugely influential and overall a very well done game"[^ref-3]. The game has been described as introducing "mouse-swing and set the standard for controls in Golf games"[^ref-4].

## Development

### Origins

Front Page Sports: Golf represented nearly three years of development by a six-person team at Headgate Studios[^ref-1]. The project marked Headgate's first venture into golf simulations and designer Vance Cook's return to the genre after his foundational work on the Links series[^ref-2]. Cook served as both director and lead programmer, bringing his expertise in golf simulation design to Sierra's Front Page Sports brand[^ref-2].

Sierra On-Line acquired Headgate Studios in 1996, bringing the developing golf simulation into their sports game portfolio[^ref-1][^ref-11]. The acquisition demonstrated Sierra's commitment to competing in the golf simulation market against established franchises like Links[^ref-4][^ref-11].

### Production

The development team employed an unusually thorough approach to course creation[^ref-1]. Team members visited actual golf courses to capture video footage and hundreds of photographs documenting every aspect of the layouts[^ref-1]. To achieve accurate overhead perspectives, planes were flown over courses to obtain aerial photographs[^ref-1]. This methodology would be applied to both the base game courses and the subsequent Tour Course Add On releases.

The multiplayer component was notably implemented late in the development cycle, as it was not part of the original design plan[^ref-1]. This addition required integration with Sierra's SIGS online gaming system, which was cutting-edge technology for the era[^ref-5].

### Technical Achievements

The game's TrueSwing interface represented a significant advancement in golf game control systems[^ref-1]. The trademarked feature allowed for nuanced swing control that contemporary reviewers found superior to competing implementations[^ref-1][^ref-2]. The success of TrueSwing led to its later implementation in PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition[^ref-1].

Graphics utilized texture-mapped polygons for golfer rendering, distinguishing the visual approach from competitors who relied on full-motion video overlays[^ref-1]. The game supported SVGA graphics with resolutions up to 1024x768 and 64,000 colors[^ref-6][^ref-5].

- **Online:** Sierra Internet Gaming System (SIGS) support[^ref-5]

### Technical Issues

The base game and presumably the add-ons were affected by several technical issues that Sierra aimed to remedy with patches[^ref-1]:

- Crashes during gameplay[^ref-1]
- Poor artificial intelligence at times[^ref-1]
- Various bugs requiring post-release patches[^ref-1]
- Putting power calibration issues where the lowest setting still required a very light touch[^ref-6]
- Sharp edges on polygons, particularly visible in sand traps and walls[^ref-6]
- Terrain that didn't blend as uniformly as other golf simulations[^ref-6]
- Installation issues reported on Windows 7[^ref-7]

GameSpot's review noted that "If your preference is extreme precision in a golf sim, FPS: Golf might not be what you're looking for"[^ref-6].

### Version History

| Version | Date | Platform | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| Base Game (Vol.1 no.1) | May 16, 1997 | Windows | Initial release[^ref-1] |
| Vol.1 no.2 | 1997 | Windows | Pasatiempo Golf Club Add-on[^ref-3] |
| Vol.1 no.3 | 1997 | Windows | Coeur D'Alene add-on course[^ref-3] |
| Vol.1 no.4 | 1997 | Windows | Black Diamond Ranche add-on course[^ref-3] |

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

The game included several humorous touches that set it apart from typical golf simulations[^ref-6][^ref-2]:

- If the player leaves the game untouched, someone screams at them from a distance[^ref-6]
- Shaking the mouse during the swing causes the character to fall on their rear end[^ref-6]
- In-game audio includes heckling such as "Hey buddy, we're losing daylight!" and "Hit the ball! I gotta be home for supper!"[^ref-2]
- The game carried a more municipal course feel compared to competitors, giving it a distinct atmosphere[^ref-2]

The game was also released under alternative titles including "DSF Golf" and "Sierra Sports Golf"[^ref-7][^ref-13]. The ESRB rated the base game "E" for Everyone, indicating family-friendly content suitable for all ages[^ref-14].

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

While specific sales figures for the Tour Course Add On packages have not been documented, the base game's critical success and the acquisition of Headgate Studios by Sierra indicated commercial viability[^ref-1]. The game established Headgate as a significant developer in the golf simulation space.

### Publishing Variations

The game was distributed in multiple regions with various publishers[^ref-4][^ref-7]:
- **Sierra On-Line, Inc.** (United States)
- **Acer TWP Corp** (Taiwan)

Regional releases were documented in Germany, Taiwan, and the United States[^ref-7].

### Fan Community

One dedicated fan noted: "This is a great little game. I've been addicted to it for about 10 years now. What I love about the game is that you can play it alone because I like to always compete with the computer opponent"[^ref-7].

The game has been described as having lasting appeal: "Still, information about it is quite hard to come by"[^ref-3], indicating that while the game maintains a devoted following, documentation and preservation have been challenging.

### Critical Perspective

Front Page Sports: Golf and its Tour Course Add On represented Sierra's serious entry into the golf simulation genre during the mid-1990s[^ref-4][^ref-5]. The game's TrueSwing interface proved influential, setting standards for control schemes that would be adopted by subsequent golf titles[^ref-4][^ref-1]. The meticulous course recreation methodology—involving on-site photography and aerial surveying—established practices that would become standard in the sports simulation industry.

The game's position as "Sierra's answer to Links"[^ref-4][^ref-5] placed it in direct competition with the dominant franchise of the era, and while it didn't ultimately dethrone Links, it carved out a respected niche among golf simulation enthusiasts. The TrueSwing technology's later adoption in PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition demonstrated the lasting impact of the control innovations pioneered in this title[^ref-1].

For 1997, the combination of innovative controls, online multiplayer through SIGS, and detailed course recreations represented a cutting-edge package[^ref-5]. Modern retrospectives acknowledge that while graphical fidelity has been surpassed, the fundamental gameplay feel and control responsiveness remain impressive by retro standards[^ref-5].
