<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 27, 2026</small>

## Overview

A.J.'s World of Discovery is an educational game for toddlers developed and published by Coktel Vision, released in 1991 for Atari ST and 1992 for DOS.[^ref-1][^ref-2][^ref-3][^ref-10][^ref-11] The game marks the debut of A.J. (known as Adibou in France), a lovable alien character who would become Coktel Vision's most famous educational mascot, appearing in dozens of titles across three decades.[^ref-1][^ref-4][^ref-14][^ref-20]

Designed for children ages 4-7, the game offers a collection of mini-games and activities in colorful VGA graphics, similar in concept to The Treehouse but targeted at a younger audience.[^ref-1][^ref-2] A.J. serves as the player's guide throughout, providing help with digitized speech that reviewers noted was "appropriate and never annoying."[^ref-1]

The game was developed by the original Adibou creative team: Roland Oskian (CEO of Coktel Vision and creator of the Adibou concept), Manuelle Mauger (content development), Arnaud Delrue (technical development), and Joseph Kluytmans (visual design).[^ref-4]

## Development

### Origins

A.J.'s World of Discovery was the first title in what would become Coktel Vision's most successful franchise.[^ref-4] The game was created by a core team of four developers who would define the series:[^ref-4]

- **Roland Oskian** - CEO of Coktel Vision, conceived the Adibou character and coordinated development
- **Manuelle Mauger** - Managed content development
- **Arnaud Delrue** - Responsible for technical development
- **Joseph Kluytmans** - Responsible for visual quality

The games were specifically designed to be applicable within a classroom context.[^ref-4]

### Production

Coktel Vision handled both development and publishing for A.J.'s World of Discovery.[^ref-1] The game was developed using the MDO system (the internal name for Coktel's development team/tools).[^ref-3] The game was designed specifically for very young children, filling a market gap for quality toddler-oriented educational software.[^ref-1]

The French version was titled "Adibou - Accompagnement Scolaire 4-7 Ans," with the name Adibou derived from the French acronym ADI meaning "Accompagnement Didacticiel Intelligent" (Intelligent Accompaniment Tutorial).[^ref-3][^ref-4]

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- A.J. was the precursor to Adibou, who became one of France's most recognizable educational game characters[^ref-4]
- The French version's name "Adibou" is derived from ADI (Accompagnement Didacticiel Intelligent)[^ref-4]
- In early floppy versions, A.J. spoke the same "strange gibberish" as characters in the Goblins series[^ref-5]
- Hidden hotspots throughout the game trigger silly animations[^ref-1]
- Original releases included a promotion where children who completed their virtual sweets collection could mail a floppy disk to Coktel Vision for actual candy rewards[^ref-5]
- Coktel Vision would be acquired by Sierra On-Line in 1993[^ref-9][^ref-19]
- Similar in concept to The Treehouse, but for younger audiences[^ref-1]
- The series was divided into age categories: Adi (10-14), Adibou (4-7), and Adiboud'chou (18 months-3 years)[^ref-4]

## Legacy

### Series Context

A.J.'s World of Discovery represents the beginning of Coktel Vision's Adibou educational franchise, which became extremely popular in France and other European markets.[^ref-1][^ref-4][^ref-12][^ref-17] By 1997, the series had sold over 1.5 million copies.[^ref-4]

The series expanded beyond games into comic books, music, and a television series (Adiboo Adventure, 2009).[^ref-4] Following various corporate changes, the IP rights eventually passed to Ubisoft, and in 2020, French company Wiloki (founded by Roland Oskian's children) partnered with Ubisoft to revive the character with new titles in 2022.[^ref-4]

**Adibou Series Timeline:**
- Adibou (A.J.'s World of Discovery) (1991) - Series debut[^ref-4]
- Adiboo: Magical Playland (1996)[^ref-4]
- Adiboo: Discover series (2000)[^ref-4]
- Adibou & Le Secret de Paziral (2003)[^ref-4]
- Adibou et les Saisons Magiques (2009) - Wii[^ref-4]
- Adibou: La Chanson d'Adibou (2022) - Revival[^ref-4]

### Critical Perspective

A.J.'s World of Discovery showcases Coktel Vision's expertise in creating engaging educational content for children. The game established design patterns that would define the Adibou series for decades: patient character guidance, garden growing mechanics, Breakout-style games, and reward systems using virtual sweets.[^ref-5]

While overshadowed in North America by Sierra's own EcoQuest and Dr. Brain series, A.J.'s World of Discovery and its Adibou successors became cultural touchstones in France, introducing a generation of French speakers to video games.[^ref-4][^ref-15][^ref-16]
