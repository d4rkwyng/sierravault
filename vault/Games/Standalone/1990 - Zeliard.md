## Overview

Zeliard is a side-scrolling action role-playing game developed by [[Game Arts]] that combines platforming mechanics with RPG elements, originally released for the NEC PC-8801 in Japan on December 19, 1987[^ref-1]. The game was subsequently ported to the Sharp X1 on May 13, 1988, before Sierra On-Line brought it to Western audiences on MS-DOS in 1990 as part of their licensing agreement with Game Arts[^ref-2]. As Game Arts' third game and their first foray into the RPG genre, Zeliard arrived at a pivotal moment in gaming history, releasing between Zelda II (January 1987) and Ys III (1989)[^ref-3].

The game represents a "curious footnote in the history of Japanese computer games," blending the entertainment of an arcade game with the adventure of a role-playing game[^ref-4]. Players take control of Duke Garland, a brave knight tasked with rescuing Princess Felicia and defeating the ancient demon Jashiin, who has cursed the kingdom of Zeliard with 115 days of devastating sand rain[^ref-5]. The game features over eight different worlds with many secrets, earning comparisons to what "Zelda II should have been" from passionate fans[^ref-6].

Sierra's Western release made considerable changes to the game engine, resulting in a version that "players and veterans consider to be a hard game, but ended up being much easier than the other two versions"[^ref-7]. The port demonstrated Sierra's commitment to bringing Japanese gaming experiences to Western audiences, alongside titles like Thexder and Sorcerian, establishing a pipeline for action-oriented titles that complemented their adventure game catalog[^ref-2].

## Story Summary

The narrative of Zeliard centers on an ancient demon called Jashiin, self-dubbed the "Emperor of Chaos," who emerges from a two-thousand-year sleep to unleash his wrath upon the Kingdom of Zeliard[^ref-5]. According to legend, the rulers of Zeliard had allegedly harmed Jashiin in ages past, and now the awakened demon seeks his terrible revenge[^ref-9]. For 115 days, a devastating sand rain falls upon the kingdom, transforming the once-prosperous land into a barren desert[^ref-5].

To complete his cruel vengeance, Jashiin turns Princess Felicia, the beloved princess of Zeliard, into stone[^ref-10]. King Felishika, desperate to save both his daughter and his kingdom, appoints Duke Garland as the kingdom's champion[^ref-8]. Guided by the Guardian Spirit, Garland must venture into deep labyrinths to defeat eight of Jashiin's most deadly minions and collect the Nine Tears of Esmesanti—holy crystals that alone possess the power to reverse the terrible curse[^ref-11].

The quest takes Duke Garland through a series of interconnected caverns and towns, each presenting unique challenges and guardians[^ref-12]. The bosses include memorable creatures such as Cangrejo (a giant crab), Pulpo (an octopus), and the infamous Pollo—a giant chicken that prompts the exclamation "Madre de Dios! Es el Pollo Diablo!" from fans[^ref-13]. Upon finally reaching Jashiin, the demon taunts the player with: "Finally, you reached me. I enjoyed your show. Come on! I'll kill you"[^ref-14]. Only by collecting all the sacred tears and defeating Jashiin can Garland hope to restore Felicia to her true form and bring peace to the kingdom of Zeliard[^ref-11].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Zeliard is a screen-scrolling, action-fantasy-adventure game that employs keyboard or joystick controls[^ref-11]. Movement is handled through arrow keys, with the spacebar used for talking to NPCs and performing actions, the Alt key for casting magic spells, and Enter for accessing the inventory screen[^ref-15]. The game supports multiple input methods, though early versions suffered from joystick detection problems on faster CPUs, which Sierra later patched in version 2.0[^ref-16].

The F-key row provides important functions: F1 toggles between music modes (including "Music On; Single Channel, Music Off, Music On; Multiple Channels, Music Off"), F2 controls sound effects, F7 restores saved games, and F9 adjusts game speed on a scale of 1-9, with 5 being normal[^ref-17]. Save files use the .USR extension and are limited to 256 bytes[^ref-7]. Players can only carry 5 items at a time, requiring strategic decisions about inventory management[^ref-13].

### Structure and Progression

The game features a Metroidvania-style structure with over eight different worlds interconnected through towns and caverns[^ref-12]. Each level consists of two interconnected maps with color-coded doors for navigation[^ref-18]. Towns serve as hubs where players can purchase weapons, armor, and spells, with shops offering progressively better equipment as the game advances[^ref-18]. A unique banking system allows players to deposit gold for safekeeping—important since dying causes resurrection with no gold unless funds were deposited beforehand[^ref-18].

**Towns and Areas:**
- **Muralla Town** – Starting location[^ref-12]
- **Satono Town** – Second major hub[^ref-12]
- **Bosque Village** – Forest-themed area[^ref-12]
- **Helada Town** – Ice region hub[^ref-12]
- **Tumba Town** – Tomb-like setting[^ref-12]
- **Dorado Town** – Gold-themed area[^ref-12]
- **Llama Town** – Fire region hub[^ref-12]
- **Pureza Town** – Final area before endgame[^ref-12]
- **Esco Village** – Secret hidden village[^ref-11]

**Caverns:**
- **Cavern of Malicia** – First dungeon, home to Cangrejo[^ref-12]
- **Cavern of Peligro** – Contains Pulpo[^ref-12]
- **Cavern of Madera/Riza** – Pollo's domain[^ref-12]
- **Cavern of Escarcha/Glaciar** – Ice caverns with Agar[^ref-12]
- **Cavern of Tesoro/Plata** – Treasure caverns with Tarso[^ref-12]
- **Cavern of Caliente/Reaccion** – Fire caverns with Dragon[^ref-12]
- **Cavern of Corroer** – Corrosive environment[^ref-12]
- **Cavern of Absor/Milagro/Desleal/Faltar** – Final cavern complex[^ref-12]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The RPG elements include character leveling, with Duke Garland gaining experience and levels through combat[^ref-6]. Currency is obtained by exchanging enemy spirits called "almas" at town banks, with different exchange ratios depending on the location[^ref-11]. The game features a magic system where visiting each town's Sage rewards players with new spells, adding tactical variety to combat[^ref-19].

Equipment progression includes multiple swords and shields, with shields featuring a damage system where they can break from overuse[^ref-4]. Special items like the Hero's Crest, Ruzeria Shoes, Pirika Shoes, Slikarn Shoes, Asbestos Cape, Elf Crest, and Fairy Enchantment Sword provide unique abilities[^ref-12]. The DOS version notably added health regeneration by standing still, a feature absent from the Japanese originals[^ref-3].

Boss fights require specific strategies—Vista, for example, "is an interesting boss, in the sense that only the Knight's Sword can harm him," while another encounter is described as "probably the hardest boss fight in the game"[^ref-20]. The game employs a grid-based screen redrawing technique that enables smooth scrolling even on slower computers[^ref-17].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

*The Games Machine* awarded Zeliard a score of 81%, recognizing the game's blend of action and adventure elements[^ref-1]. The game earned praise as a "classic imbued with personality" from *Planetstation Magazine*[^ref-1]. Contemporary reviews noted that the game offered strong value for players seeking arcade-style action combined with RPG progression systems[^ref-4].

The game's musical score received particular acclaim, with one reviewer noting "This game has some of the best chip tunes of any computer game"[^ref-4]. The graphics were described as "rather lovely," while "the sound and music edge just north of 'tolerable' (which is actually quite good for this era)"[^ref-21]. The game was characterized as an "impressive action adventure game from the makers of Thexder"[^ref-2].

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospectives have offered more nuanced evaluations of Zeliard. Hardcore Gaming 101 observed that "What could have been a classic of the genre is sadly held back by three big issues: the difficulty, the choppy controls and the disorienting level design," while also noting "Playing Zeliard is a bit like taking on a new hobby: first you get intrigued and decide to try it out, then there is a learning phase where most attempts don't go as planned"[^ref-3]. The CRPG Addict gave the game a score of 36, noting "It's fun. It won't become a part of my soul or anything, but it's a good play"[^ref-21].

User reviews characterize it as an "Excellent early platform game. And you can't go wrong with game arts" and "A very consolish action platform game with an adventurey quality"[^ref-2]. One passionate fan declared "This game is what Zelda II should have been"[^ref-6]. The game is considered a worthy experience despite its age: "It won't be the best JRPG you'll experience, but it's certainly worth looking into"[^ref-4].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** 7.1/10 (Moby Score), 51% (Critics), 3.7/5 (Players)[^ref-2]
- **Free Game Empire:** 4/5 (user rating)[^ref-22]
- **MyAbandonware:** 4.67/5 (85 votes)[^ref-6]
- **Comma Eight Comma One:** 7/10[^ref-4]
- **PixelatedArcade:** A[^ref-23]

## Development

### Origins

Zeliard emerged as Game Arts' third title following their successful debut with Thexder (1985)[^ref-22]. Founded on March 2, 1985, under president Yōichi Miyaji, Game Arts sought to expand beyond their action game roots into the role-playing genre[^ref-22]. The development team designed an ambitious project that would combine platforming mechanics with RPG progression, creating what Japanese marketing materials described as featuring "計算しつくされたマップや仕掛けがキミを待つ" (calculated maps and mechanisms await you) and "超リアルな動作に思わず感情移入してしまう" (super-realistic movement that makes you emotionally invested)[^ref-24].

The game was originally designed for the NEC PC-8801mkII SR, utilizing the platform's capabilities for detailed sprite work—the main character alone featured 336 patterns multiplied by sword patterns multiplied by 2 (for left/right directions)[^ref-24]. The original Japanese release retailed for ¥8,100 (¥7,500 before tax) on 5" 2D floppy disks[^ref-24].

### Production

Sierra On-Line acquired the rights to publish Zeliard in Western markets as part of their licensing agreement with Game Arts, which also brought titles like Thexder and Silpheed to DOS[^ref-2]. The DOS port became the first lead project for [[Josh Mandel]], who would later become known for his work on various Sierra adventure games[^ref-8]. Sierra made considerable changes to the game engine after obtaining the PC-88 version, implementing difficulty reductions to make the game more accessible to Western audiences[^ref-3].

The localization process introduced notable changes: enemies give more experience points, the Alma:Gold exchange rates are more favorable, health regenerates by standing still, and the death penalty is less severe[^ref-3]. Interestingly, most place names in the English version use Spanish words—Muralla (wall), Bosque (forest), Helada (frozen), Llama (flame)—giving the Western release a distinctive flavor[^ref-21]. One significant omission in the DOS version was the digitized voices present in the Japanese original, including the sound of falling rain and Felicia's scream in the introduction[^ref-2].

**Development Credits:**[^ref-2]
- **Composers:** Fumihito Kasatani, Nobuyuki Aoshima
- **Additional Music:** Mecano Associates (credited on Tandy version)[^ref-25]
- **Additional Composers (Tandy):** Hibiki Godai, Masakuni Mitsuhashi[^ref-25]
- **DOS Port Lead:** Josh Mandel[^ref-8]

### Technical Achievements

Zeliard demonstrated impressive technical capabilities for its era, supporting a wide range of graphics modes: MCGA (64 colors), EGA (16 colors, at an unusual 640x200 resolution rather than the standard 320x200), Tandy (16 colors), CGA (4 colors), and Hercules (2 colors)[^ref-3]. The game employed a grid-based screen redrawing technique that enabled smooth 2D scrolling even on slower computers of the period[^ref-17].

The audio implementation was particularly sophisticated for a late-1980s title. Zeliard supported multiple audio configurations including Roland MT-32, AdLib, Tandy 3-voice, and PC internal speaker[^ref-23]. The game was notably one of the few titles that allowed players to use different hardware for music and sound effects simultaneously, and it supported multiple-channel PC Speaker music—an unusual feature[^ref-2]. The complete soundtrack spans approximately 35-43 minutes depending on the platform version, with recordings preserved from the original Roland MT-32 MIDI score[^ref-26].

### Cut Content

The MS-DOS version omitted several features present in the original PC-8801 release. Most notably, digitized voices were not implemented in the English translation, including atmospheric sounds of falling rain during the introduction sequence and Princess Felicia's scream when she is turned to stone[^ref-2]. The hidden string "Special mode !!" appears at offset 8ED in zeliard.exe, suggesting potentially unfinished or removed special features[^ref-7].

### Version History

| Version | Date | Platform | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| 1.0 | December 19, 1987 | PC-8801mkII SR | Original Japanese release[^ref-1] |
| 1.0 | May 13, 1988 | X1/turbo | Japanese Sharp X1 port[^ref-1] |
| 1.208 | 1990 | MS-DOS | US release, uses .bat file for setup[^ref-7] |
| 2.0 | 1990 | MS-DOS | Uses Sierra's SCI0 installer/setup .exe[^ref-7] |

**SCI Interpreter Versions:**[^ref-7]

| Game Version | Interpreter | Type | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|------|-------|
| 1.208 | Custom | Batch-based | Uses .bat file for configuration |
| 2.0 | SCI0 | Sierra Installer | Fixed joystick detection for faster CPUs |

### Technical Issues

The original DOS version suffered from joystick detection problems on faster CPUs, requiring players to perform a fresh cold boot to get the joystick working again after the first load[^ref-16]. Sierra addressed this issue in version 2.0, fixing the joystick detection code—a patch that was also applied to related titles like Silpheed[^ref-16].

Some users have reported save game loading issues, and the game may experience problems running under DOSBox, occasionally forcing CGA mode during installation[^ref-4]. When running under emulation, a DOSBox cycle setting of approximately 50000 is recommended for optimal performance[^ref-28]. A common error involves RESOURCE.CFG issues on launch when using DOSBox[^ref-27].

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

Zeliard contains several hidden secrets and bonus content that dedicated players can discover:

- **Secret Village:** Esco Village is a hidden location accessible through secret passages[^ref-11]
- **Secret Equipment:** Hidden sword, free swords, secret shield, and Feruza Shoes can be found throughout the caverns[^ref-11]
- **Hidden String:** An odd string "Special mode !!" appears at offset 8ED in zeliard.exe, purpose unknown[^ref-7]
- **El Pollo Diablo:** The third boss, Pollo (a giant chicken), has become a fan favorite, inspiring the exclamation "Madre de Dios! Es el Pollo Diablo!"[^ref-13]
- **Spanish Naming:** Most location names are Spanish words—Muralla (wall), Bosque (forest), Helada (frozen), Caliente (hot), Escarcha (frost)[^ref-21]
- **Command Line Parameters:** Various shortcuts and command line parameters exist for advanced users[^ref-11]
- **Speed Adjustment:** The F9 key allows real-time speed adjustment (1-9), useful for difficult platforming sections or boss fights[^ref-12]

### Notorious Box Art

When Sierra brought Zeliard to Western markets, they commissioned new box art that departed significantly from the original Japanese anime aesthetic. PC Gamer later listed the European release as having "one of the worst box covers of all time" in a 2017 retrospective, with the reviewer noting "When Sierra brought this late 80s JRPG/platformer to the west, they decided this was the right look to represent its anime-style art. I don't even know what's going on with that slug's lips"[^ref-29]. The marketing tagline "Get into Zeliard – because you can" has become somewhat infamous among fans[^ref-3].

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

While specific sales figures for Zeliard are not readily available, the game represented an important part of Sierra's strategy to diversify their catalog through Japanese partnerships[^ref-6]. The licensing agreement with Game Arts brought several action-oriented titles to Western audiences who might not otherwise have experienced Japanese gaming styles[^ref-6]. The game introduced many Western players to their "first exposure to Japanese gaming mentality" and the side-scrolling action RPG genre, which was "rare on DOS platform"[^ref-30].

### Collections

Zeliard has not been re-released through major digital distribution platforms like GOG or Steam, limiting its modern availability to abandonware sources and emulation[^ref-31]. The game's absence from official digital storefronts has led to community campaigns requesting its addition to platforms like GOG[^ref-31].

### Fan Projects

Due to Zeliard's "rather unsatisfying ending, several gamers have been left with the urge to play a sequel"[^ref-32]. The fan community has attempted various projects including Flash-based remakes and modern engine recreations[^ref-32]. As one fan site notes, "Although compared to modern games, Zeliard may look like something trivial, but there is still a considerable amount of effort that goes into creating a game engine for it and getting all the aspects of the game play right"[^ref-32].

A dedicated fan FAQ was written "at the insistance of a friend of mine, who happens to be the president of the Zeliard fan Club," demonstrating the game's devoted following[^ref-12]. Community-created maps for various caverns were contributed between 2008-2009, and comprehensive boss guides remain available through GameFAQs and Neoseeker[^ref-14].

### Related Publications

- **Original Manual:** Included with retail release, contains installation instructions and gameplay information[^ref-33]
- **Cavern Maps Poster:** Large poster containing maps of each game cavern included with retail copies[^ref-2]
- **Fan-Created FAQs:** Multiple comprehensive walkthroughs created between 2000-2005, including versions by Alan Franciškovic (v1.2, August 2001), NeoZenogias (December 2000), and Sashanan (v1.3 Boss FAQ, September 2005)[^ref-11]

### Critical Perspective

Zeliard occupies an interesting position in gaming history as one of several Japanese action-RPGs that Sierra brought to Western audiences during the late 1980s and early 1990s. While never achieving the recognition of contemporaries like Zelda II or the Ys series, the game demonstrated that there was an audience for console-style action RPGs on personal computers[^ref-6]. The title showcased Game Arts' ability to blend genres effectively—a skill the studio would later refine with the critically acclaimed Grandia and Lunar series[^ref-30].

The game's legacy is somewhat bittersweet. Despite passionate fan advocacy and lasting appreciation from those who discovered it, Zeliard never received a sequel from Sierra or Game Arts[^ref-32]. Its difficulty and occasionally "choppy controls" prevented it from achieving broader success, yet those same challenging elements created devoted fans who continue to speedrun and discuss the game decades later[^ref-3]. As one reviewer summarized: "Although the graphics aren't excellent, but the game play is"—a testament to solid game design that transcends its technical limitations[^ref-15].
