# Lighthouse: The Dark Being

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

Lighthouse: The Dark Being is a first-person adventure game developed and published by Sierra On-Line in 1996[^ref-1]. The game was conceived when Sierra's Ken Williams challenged designer Jon Bock to create something similar to Myst, famously pulling out a copy of the game and asking "Can you do this?"[^ref-2]. Set in a "supernatural mechanical world," the game follows a struggling writer who becomes embroiled in a parallel dimension crisis involving a mysterious lighthouse and its eccentric inhabitants[^ref-3].

Often dismissed as a "Myst clone" due to its first-person perspective and pre-rendered environments, Lighthouse manages to leave its own mark on the genre by carrying Sierra's traditionally challenging puzzle design into the new style of graphic adventure games[^ref-4]. The game features pre-rendered 3D graphics created using Autodesk 3D Studio and Alias, with Jon Bock describing it as a "Science Fiction Folk Tale" inspired by the machine age, Leonardo Da Vinci drawings, and H.G. Wells stories[^ref-2].

Lighthouses seem to invoke a kind of mystery that few things do[^ref-collection], and Lighthouse capitalizes on this atmosphere to create an experience that PC Gamer (US) called "a fantasy-horror adventure that's a cut above most post-Myst games"[^ref-17]. When comparing it to its obvious inspiration, one reviewer asked "Is it better than Myst? Much better (though, around here, that's not saying much)"[^ref-collection]. The game's tagline—"Outwit Evil in a Supernatural Mechanical World"—captures its blend of horror, science fiction, and steampunk aesthetics.

## Story Summary

The player takes control of a struggling writer who has recently moved into a cottage on the Oregon coast[^ref-6]. Near the cottage stands a lighthouse inhabited by the eccentric Dr. Jeremiah Krick and his daughter Amanda[^ref-7]. When Dr. Krick's experiments with parallel dimensions go awry, a malevolent entity known as the "Dark Being" kidnaps baby Amanda and takes her to a bizarre parallel world[^ref-8].

The protagonist must venture into this alternate dimension to rescue Amanda, traveling through six distinctly different regions while encountering a cast of intriguing characters[^ref-9]. The parallel world is described as featuring "exquisitely rendered landscapes" filled with exotic architecture and inventions[^ref-10]. The visual design blends steampunk aesthetics with folktale imagery, creating environments like the Temple of the Ancient Machines, described as "beautiful and sad; its wind-battered stone walls protect the keys to the planet's future, yet it clearly has only a short time left before falling into oblivion"[^ref-collection].

Central to the rescue mission is the construction of an "Ionizing Cannon," whose seven pieces are scattered throughout the various locations in the parallel world[^ref-8]. Krick's notes reference the real physical concept of Godel's universe, grounding the fantastical premise in actual scientific theory[^ref-11]. The game draws inspiration from H.P. Lovecraft's concepts of alternate realities, dark gods, and scientists who toy with forces they do not understand, mixed with Jules Verne wonder and imagination[^ref-collection]. One puzzle even features a Chinese puzzle box right out of Hellraiser[^ref-collection].

An interesting detail: the player character's gender is never explicitly defined, but a handbag suggests a female protagonist[^ref-collection], an unusual ambiguity for games of this era.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Lighthouse employs a first-person perspective with locations represented as pre-rendered still screens[^ref-7]. Interaction with the environment is performed through a simple single-cursor, point-and-click interface, similar to Myst's navigation system[^ref-12]. The game's version 2.0 patch added a "Highlight Cursor" option, with Sierra recommending players enable this feature "unless the player wants the added challenge of the inactive cursor"[^ref-13].

The interface has been criticized for being "fussy"—there is no hot spot icon to tell you where valuable objects or interactive elements are, and many inventory objects need to be clicked more than once, and very precisely, to be picked up or used[^ref-collection]. This design philosophy aligns with Sierra's traditional approach of challenging players to thoroughly explore and experiment.

### Structure and Progression

The game offers multiple paths and alternate puzzle solutions, providing various ways to experience the story and reach different endings[^ref-14]. According to the Player's Handbook included with the GOG release, the game features 16 total endings and over a dozen possible solutions[^ref-collection]. Players explore six different regions in the parallel world, each with distinct visual themes and challenges[^ref-9]. Unlike traditional Sierra adventures, Lighthouse does not feature a point system[^ref-15].

The game's non-linear structure allows for different approaches to puzzle-solving and story progression. One walkthrough notes: "There are many different paths and alternate puzzle solutions to complete Lighthouse"[^ref-collection], rewarding replay and experimentation.

### Puzzles and Mechanics

As with Myst, puzzles are notable for their difficulty and rely more on logic than inventory management, consisting of careful observation, clue gathering, and environmental manipulation[^ref-12]. The game includes a significant maze section that occupies approximately one-quarter of the total gameplay[^ref-16]. Sierra's traditional "player-hostile house style" is evident in the challenging nature of the puzzles, which can leave players genuinely lost or stranded in the bizarre world[^ref-4].

One reviewer noted: "Games like Myst threaten to get you lost or stranded in a bizarre world you don't fully understand. Lighthouse actually has the gall to carry through with it"[^ref-collection]. The game features difficulty spikes, dead ends, and frustrating inventory puzzles[^ref-collection]. Notoriously, players can get stuck if they forgot to pick up an umbrella from the house at the start[^ref-collection], and the submarine piloting section features dozens of unlabeled knobs and levers[^ref-collection].

The version 2.0 patch modified some of the more difficult puzzles and added indicator lights in various locations to improve playability[^ref-13]. Sierra later released patches that addressed some of the game's difficulty spikes and added a much-needed hint system[^ref-collection].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| PC Gamer (US) | 82% | Called it "a fantasy-horror adventure that's a cut above most post-Myst games"[^ref-17] |
| GameSpot | 6.4/10 | Reviewed by Rebecca Anderson, noted graphics as "moving picture book"[^ref-18] |
| Entertainment Weekly | C- | Dismissed as "a talentless rip-off of a Stephen King novel"[^ref-2] |
| Quandary | 4/5 | Positive review from November 1996[^ref-19] |
| Computer Games Magazine | 3/5 | Review from January 1999[^ref-19] |
| Game Revolution | C- | Review from October 1996[^ref-19] |

Contemporary reception was mixed. Rebecca Anderson's GameSpot review noted that "graphically, Lighthouse is, at its heart, a moving picture book"[^ref-collection], praising its visual presentation while warning "novices and wanna-be adventurers, beware"[^ref-collection] about its difficulty. PC Gamer's T. Liam McDonald described it as "a somewhat flawed but overall entertaining trip through a parallel world"[^ref-collection].

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospective reviews have been more appreciative of the game's ambitious design. Adventure Classic Gaming awarded it 4/5 stars in 2009, while Just Adventure gave it a B+ rating in 2003[^ref-19]. Adventure Gamers rated it 3.5/5 stars, noting it as an "entertaining and beguiling game, however, if you hate mazes steer clear"[^ref-16]. GOG.com users have rated it 4.1/5 stars based on 35 reviews[^ref-20], with MyAbandonware users giving it 4.11/5[^ref-21]. MobyGames shows an aggregate score of 69%[^ref-6].

One GOG user enthusiastically recalled: "One of the best games I have ever played, use to play this so much when I was a kid"[^ref-collection]. Another noted: "It is similar to Myst in its first person view, navigation system and some visual elements, but the similarity ends where the actual game starts"[^ref-collection], suggesting the game has its own distinct identity.

GameFAQs walkthrough author Mark Fox assessed: "Lighthouse is an excellent adventure game designed with the die-hard gamer in mind. The puzzles are challenging and the animation is superb"[^ref-collection].

## Development

### Origins

The game's development began when Sierra's Ken Williams called Jon Bock into his office, showed him a copy of Myst, and asked "Can you do this?" Bock responded affirmatively, and the game went into development as Sierra's attempt to capitalize on Myst's success[^ref-2]. This marked the first and only game designed by Sierra art director Jon Bock[^ref-22].

The timing was deliberate: Myst had taken the gaming world by storm in 1993, and Sierra sought to capture some of that market while maintaining their own design philosophy. Unlike pure Myst imitators, Lighthouse retained Sierra's challenging puzzle design and willingness to let players fail—characteristics that defined the company's adventure games.

### Production

The game's landscapes were created using Autodesk 3D Studio and Alias software, with animation work performed on SGI machines and motion capture handled by Biovision[^ref-5]. The game was one of the first adventure games with fully rendered and motion captured characters[^ref-collection], representing a significant technical achievement for its time.

The voice cast included Phil Proctor as Dr. Jeremiah Krick, Kerrigan Mahan as the Dark Being, Romy Cutler-Lengyel as Liryl, and Leigh French as Mom[^ref-23]. Marc Eckelberry voiced the Computer, and Andy Goldberg played the Editor. The musical score was composed by Brian Min and Victor Crews[^ref-1], creating an atmospheric soundscape that left lasting impressions on players—one fan was inspired to create a metal concept album based on the soundtrack[^ref-collection].

Jon Bock drew inspiration from diverse sources, referring to the game as a "Science Fiction Folk Tale" that blended machine age aesthetics with fantasy elements. The Birdman character and tower design were originally from a D&D adventure called "The Roost"[^ref-collection], demonstrating how tabletop gaming influences found their way into computer game design.

### Technical Achievements

Lighthouse utilized Sierra's SCI (Sierra Creative Interpreter) engine and featured pre-rendered 3D environments with full-motion video sequences[^ref-5]. The game was part of Sierra's move toward more cinematic adventure games in the mid-1990s[^ref-22]. However, the game suffered from technical compatibility issues, particularly with Windows installations, leading many users to prefer the DOS version[^ref-24].

The game spans two CD-ROMs[^ref-collection], containing the vast amount of pre-rendered content needed for its six distinct regions. System requirements included a 486DX66 processor, 12 MB RAM for Windows 95 (8 MB for DOS), and a 4X CD-ROM drive with 200 MB of hard drive space[^ref-collection].

One user noted the installation challenges: "I had an insane amount of trouble with the Windows install. I found it much easier just to go through DOS"[^ref-collection]. Like many later Sierra DOS SCI games, Lighthouse has known technical issues that persist to this day[^ref-collection].

## Legacy

Despite being commonly dismissed as a Myst clone, Lighthouse has maintained a dedicated following among adventure game enthusiasts[^ref-25]. The game's challenging puzzle design and atmospheric presentation have been both praised and criticized, with some noting that it "manages the awkward feat of carrying Sierra's frustrating, player-hostile house style over to this new style of adventure game"[^ref-4].

Collection Chamber's retrospective noted: "Lighthouse: The Dark Being takes the former approach and teaches you everything about how not to be a parent"[^ref-collection], highlighting the game's dark narrative themes. Despite sharing many genes with Myst, Lighthouse is very much a game fathered by Sierra[^ref-collection], blending the contemplative exploration of Cyan's masterpiece with Sierra's trademark difficulty.

The game received multiple patches to address difficulty issues and add visual clues to puzzles[^ref-26]. Modern players can access the game through GOG.com with ScummVM support, ensuring continued compatibility with contemporary systems. The GOG release includes the "Lighthouse Player's Handbook," providing documentation of the game's multiple endings and solutions.

The game's influence extends to the community of adventure game enthusiasts who continue to discover and appreciate its unique blend of science fiction, horror, and puzzle design. Reddit discussions in r/creepygaming describe it as "a spooky and obscure myst-esque game by Sierra" with "a pretty eerie atmosphere and some very weird and uncanny character models"[^ref-collection].
