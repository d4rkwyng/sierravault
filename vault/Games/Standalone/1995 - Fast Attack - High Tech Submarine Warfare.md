<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 11, 2026</small>

## Overview

Fast Attack: High Tech Submarine Warfare is a submarine combat simulation developed by Software Sorcery and published by [[Sierra On-Line]] in 1995 for DOS systems.[^ref-1] The game places players in command of a Los Angeles Class 688I nuclear-powered attack submarine, widely considered one of the most sophisticated naval vessels ever constructed.[^ref-2] Standing at the helm of this advanced warship, players have access to the most sensitive sensors, navigation systems, and state-of-the-art communications equipment available to the United States Navy.[^ref-3]

The simulation was notable for its uncompromising approach to realism, offering players a closer approximation of modern undersea combat than any previous title in the genre.[^ref-4] Using strategy and stealth, players monitor the movement of hostile targets, destroy enemy ships and submarines, hunt for mines, and attack enemy convoys.[^ref-2] The game's tagline encapsulated its philosophy: "In high-tech submarine warfare, there are no problems. Only solutions."[^ref-2] The stakes were made abundantly clear to players—should they fail their mission objectives, their "final rest will be upon the ocean floor."[^ref-3]

Development of Fast Attack benefited from authentic military consultation, with members of the USS Pogy (SSN-647) and Admiral Robert "Yogi" Kaufman contributing their expertise to ensure the simulation's accuracy.[^ref-5] This attention to detail resulted in what reviewers called an "incredibly complex, yet easy to grasp and operate" experience that smoothly integrated numerous complex elements into a working game of substantial depth.[^ref-6]

## Story Summary

Fast Attack places players in the role of a submarine commander during various Cold War-era and post-Cold War scenarios, commanding missions across multiple global hotspots. The narrative framework presents a series of increasingly challenging military operations where the player must protect American interests while maintaining diplomatic protocols.[^ref-3]

The game's missions span multiple battlesets including operations in the Sea of Japan, where players engage in tense standoffs with hostile naval forces.[^ref-4] Each scenario presents unique tactical challenges, from convoy interdiction to mine hunting operations, requiring players to balance aggressive action with the need to preserve their crew's safety and maintain the diplomatic position of the United States.[^ref-3]

The stakes of each mission are presented in stark military terms—complete the objectives and preserve your command, or face the ultimate consequence. As the game ominously warns, failure means players will "rest forever in Davy Jones' Locker."[^ref-2] This narrative framing emphasizes the deadly serious nature of submarine warfare, where a single mistake can prove catastrophic in the cold, crushing depths of the ocean.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Fast Attack presents players with a comprehensive simulation of submarine operations through multiple station screens and tactical displays. The game features both first-person and third-person perspectives, allowing players to switch between detailed control stations and external views of their vessel.[^ref-7] The interface integrates sonar displays, navigation systems, weapons control, and communications equipment into a cohesive command experience.[^ref-2]

The sonar screen serves as the primary tactical display, presenting acoustic data in a manner consistent with actual submarine operations.[^ref-8] Players must interpret contact information, track targets, and coordinate firing solutions using realistic procedures. The simulation includes wire-guided torpedo systems, requiring players to maintain guidance on their weapons after launch.[^ref-4]

### Structure and Progression

The game is organized around discrete mission scenarios, each presenting specific objectives that must be completed within a strict two-hour time limit.[^ref-1] This artificial constraint, while controversial among players, added urgency to operations that might otherwise unfold slowly given the methodical nature of submarine warfare.[^ref-6]

Missions take players through various operational theaters:

- **Defensive Operations:** Protecting the Los Angeles area against submarine and mine threats[^ref-5]
- **Convoy Interdiction:** Attacking enemy supply convoys using stealth and overwhelming firepower[^ref-2]
- **Mine Hunting:** Locating and neutralizing underwater mines using specialized equipment[^ref-2]
- **Anti-Submarine Warfare:** Engaging and destroying enemy submarines in underwater duels[^ref-2]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The core gameplay revolves around mastering the complex systems of a nuclear attack submarine. Players have access to the entire arsenal of the 688i submarine, from Mark 48 torpedoes to UGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles and Tomahawk cruise missiles.[^ref-6] Some Los Angeles class boats feature vertical launch tubes capable of deploying Tomahawk missiles for land-attack missions.[^ref-6]

Sonar mechanics form the foundation of tactical play, as players must detect, classify, and track contacts while managing their own acoustic signature. Speed management is critical—the faster a submarine travels, the more noise it generates, making it detectable from greater distances.[^ref-9] Successful commanders learn to balance the need for speed against the imperative of remaining undetected.

Torpedo engagement requires careful consideration of firing solutions, running depth, and guidance options. The simulation models wire-guided weapons, allowing players to actively steer torpedoes toward their targets until impact or wire break.[^ref-4] This adds a layer of tactical complexity beyond simply launching weapons and hoping for the best.

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Fast Attack received a polarized reception upon release, with critics praising its exceptional realism while criticizing its technical stability. SUBSIM.com, a specialized submarine simulation review site, awarded the game a score of 79 out of 100 in its original release form, which improved to 87 after patching.[^ref-4] Reviewer Neal Stevens declared that "none holds a candle to the tense action and rigorous pacing of Fast Attack" when comparing it to other submarine simulations.[^ref-4]

The measure of realism achieved by Fast Attack was described as "unmatched" among contemporary submarine games.[^ref-4] Stevens noted that players could "get closer to a realistic modern undersea combat than ever before" with the simulation.[^ref-4] However, this praise came with significant caveats regarding the game's technical problems at launch.

Critics were harsh about the stability issues that plagued the initial release. Stevens memorably described the game as "a troubled genius" and stated bluntly that "forty dollars is too much to pay for a simulation that won't work reliably, even if the concept and execution is superb."[^ref-4] Reports indicated that the original program crashed approximately one out of every three games.[^ref-4]

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospective analysis has been more forgiving, with the understanding that patches eventually resolved many technical issues. Old PC Gaming noted that "I can't think of another game running under DOS that so smoothly integrates so many complex elements into a working game of substantial depth."[^ref-6] The site praised the simulation as "incredibly complex, yet easy to grasp and operate."[^ref-6]

## Development

### Origins

Fast Attack emerged from Sierra On-Line's strategy to diversify beyond adventure games into simulation titles during the mid-1990s. The project was developed by Software Sorcery, working under the Sierra/Dynamix umbrella.[^ref-4] The development team set out to create the most realistic modern submarine simulation possible, focusing on the Los Angeles class attack submarine—one of the most capable naval vessels in the world.[^ref-6]

The Los Angeles class represented the backbone of the U.S. Navy's submarine fleet, designed in response to Soviet submarine technological advances during the late 1960s.[^ref-10] These vessels, built by Newport News Shipbuilding and General Dynamics Electric Boat, featured nuclear propulsion enabling unlimited range and extended underwater endurance.[^ref-10] The 688I variant specifically modeled in the game represented the quietest and most capable iteration of the class, featuring advanced sonar and the ability to conduct under-ice operations.[^ref-10]

### Production

The development team secured authentic military consultation to ensure accuracy. Members of the USS Pogy (SSN-647) contributed their operational experience, while Admiral Robert "Yogi" Kaufman provided strategic guidance on submarine tactics and procedures.[^ref-5] This collaboration resulted in authentic systems modeling and realistic tactical scenarios.

Development reportedly concluded under challenging circumstances. According to SUBSIM's analysis, "the development team appeared to be relieved of contractual obligations after turning program over to Sierra," suggesting the project's completion may have been rushed or troubled.[^ref-4] This may explain some of the stability issues that plagued the initial release.

### Technical Issues

The original release of Fast Attack was plagued by significant stability problems that marred an otherwise exceptional simulation. Memory conflicts caused frequent crashes, with reports indicating the program failed approximately one out of every three gaming sessions.[^ref-4] These issues were particularly frustrating given the game's lack of a save function—players who experienced a crash during a lengthy mission had to restart from the beginning.[^ref-6]

Time compression, while useful for accelerating the slow-paced nature of submarine operations, was identified as a potential crash trigger.[^ref-4] Players learned to use this feature sparingly to avoid losing progress. The combination of stability issues and the two-hour mission time limit created a punishing experience where technical failures could waste substantial player investment.

Additional gameplay limitations noted by critics included:
- No save game option during missions[^ref-4]
- No multiplayer support[^ref-4]
- Inability to set torpedo running depth[^ref-6]
- Weak artificial intelligence—"enemies behave like cooks who suddenly found themselves in charge of a ship"[^ref-6]

The version 1.01 patch, released in February 1998, addressed many of these issues, improving Windows 95 stability and fixing AI problems.[^ref-4] Player-created patches also emerged, with one of the first removing the controversial two-hour mission time limit.[^ref-1]

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- The Los Angeles class submarines are named after cities rather than marine animals, reportedly because Admiral Hyman G. Rickover observed that "Fish don't vote."[^ref-10]
- Members of an actual nuclear submarine (USS Pogy, SSN-647) contributed to the game's development[^ref-5]
- The 688I designation refers to the Flight III variant of the Los Angeles class, which began construction in 1982 and featured significantly quieter operation and advanced sonar systems[^ref-10]
- Real Los Angeles class submarines can travel at over 25 knots submerged officially, with some reports suggesting speeds exceeding 33 knots[^ref-10]
