# Slater & Charlie Go Camping: A Talking Book I Can Read "All By Myself."

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 9, 2026</small>

## Overview

Slater & Charlie Go Camping is an educational interactive storybook released by Sierra On-Line on May 19, 1993, for MS-DOS and Macintosh platforms[^ref-1][^ref-2]. The game features Slater the Petrosaur, the protagonist from Sierra's Oil's Well remake, who "has got himself a buddy in the form of Charlie, another dinosaur of indeterminate species"[^ref-3]. Together, these dinosaur characters embark on a camping adventure designed to teach children about outdoor safety and nature through interactive storytelling[^ref-2].

Developed using Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI) engine[^ref-4], this educational title was part of Sierra's broader push into the children's software market in the early 1990s. The game was designed to compete with Brøderbund's popular Living Books series[^ref-5] and represents Sierra's first release from their Red Dog division[^ref-5]. Contemporary reviewers described it as "a remarkably smooth blend of children's storybooks with Saturday morning cartoons"[^ref-1], though noted it was "not quite as richly animated as the Living Books"[^ref-1].

## Story Summary

The story follows Slater the Petrosaur and his dinosaur companion Charlie as they prepare for and embark on a camping trip in the great outdoors[^ref-6]. "Together, they visit various locations and undertake various tasks toward the end of enjoying a camping trip in the great outdoors together"[^ref-7]. The narrative spans 12 pages about their camping adventure[^ref-5], incorporating educational elements about outdoor safety and nature appreciation throughout their journey[^ref-2].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The game is "presented as a series of static images, described in text at the bottom of the screen -- then optionally narrated for children whose reading skills aren't yet up to keeping up with the plot"[^ref-7]. Players interact with the story by clicking on various objects and "hot spots" that trigger animations and sounds[^ref-8]. The interface is designed for mouse control[^ref-9] and features interactive elements similar to a pop-up book with hidden animation hotspots[^ref-10].

### Structure and Progression

Slater & Charlie Go Camping offers two distinct play modes: "Read To Me" and "Let Me Play"[^ref-5], allowing children of different reading levels to engage with the content appropriately. The game targets children aged 3-8 years[^ref-11] and is played from a third-person perspective[^ref-2][^ref-1]. Players advance the story by clicking on interactive objects and exploring each scene for hidden animations and educational content[^ref-2].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Rather than traditional puzzles, the game focuses on discovery-based interaction where children click on various elements in each scene to uncover animations, sounds, and educational content. The educational mechanics are seamlessly integrated into the camping narrative, teaching concepts about nature, outdoor safety, and camping preparations without feeling overtly instructional[^ref-9].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Computer Gaming World | Positive | "a remarkably smooth blend of children's storybooks with Saturday morning cartoons"[^ref-1] |
| PC Magazine | Mixed | "not quite as richly animated as the Living Books, the story still has lots of hot spots for younger children"[^ref-1] |
| MobyGames (Katakis) | 42% | User review from 2016[^ref-5] |

### Modern Assessment

Modern retro gaming sites have given the title mixed to positive reception. DOS Zone rates it 5.0/5[^ref-12], while MyAbandonware users rate it 4.67/5[^ref-13]. The game is described as "a colorful and fun interactive storybook"[^ref-13] and continues to be available for browser-based play on various abandonware sites[^ref-12][^ref-14].

## Development

### Origins

The development of Slater & Charlie Go Camping represented Sierra On-Line's strategic entry into the educational software market in the early 1990s. The company sought to compete directly with Brøderbund's successful Living Books series by creating their own interactive storybook franchise[^ref-5]. The choice to feature Slater the Petrosaur, a character from Sierra's Oil's Well remake, provided brand continuity within Sierra's catalog[^ref-3][^ref-10].

### Production

Bill Davis served as the game's designer, director, producer, artist, and writer[^ref-2][^ref-4], making it a largely single-vision project. Neal Grandstaff composed the music[^ref-4][^ref-1], which was originally arranged using Roland Sound Canvas SC-55 technology[^ref-15]. Ashley Peldon provided narration for the story[^ref-5][^ref-9], giving voice to the optional audio component that made the title accessible to pre-readers.

The game utilized Sierra's patented technology that enabled a "talking book that doesn't require a CD-ROM drive"[^ref-9], allowing the full audio experience to be delivered via floppy disk. This technical achievement was marketed as a significant advantage, as Sierra promoted the game as being "so much fun, your children won't notice they're learning"[^ref-9].

### Technical Achievements

Slater & Charlie Go Camping was developed using Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI) engine[^ref-4][^ref-11], the same technology that powered many of Sierra's adventure games. The title required a minimum of an AT 286 processor, 640K RAM, and supported both EGA and VGA 256 color graphics[^ref-9]. For optimal experience, Sierra recommended a 386/486 at 25MHz with over 600K DOS memory, 3MB extended memory, and 256 color VGA/MCGA graphics capability[^ref-11].

The game was released in multiple formats, including both floppy disk and CD-ROM versions[^ref-5]. The floppy version measured 5,444 KB while the automatic version was 9,690 KB[^ref-16]. The preservation-quality archives measure approximately 16.7M[^ref-3], reflecting the compressed nature of the original distribution media.

## Legacy

While Slater & Charlie Go Camping didn't achieve the lasting popularity of some other Sierra educational titles, it represents an important step in the company's diversification beyond traditional adventure games. The game's approach to interactive storytelling influenced later educational software development, and its use of familiar Sierra characters helped establish a template for cross-franchise educational content.

The title remains available through various preservation efforts, including the Internet Archive[^ref-17][^ref-18][^ref-3] and abandonware sites[^ref-13][^ref-14]. A comprehensive soundtrack preservation project by Xeen Music has ensured that the original MIDI compositions remain accessible, including "unused music, jingles, and every last note so nothing is lost to time"[^ref-15].

The game continues to appear on GOG.com's community wishlist with over 102 votes[^ref-19], indicating ongoing interest in official digital re-release. However, searches on major digital platforms like Steam[^ref-20] and GOG's main catalog[^ref-21] show no current availability for purchase.

While Slater & Charlie Go Camping does not directly continue the narrative of Pepper's Adventures in Time, it shares a common thread with other Sierra titles by incorporating educational elements and interactive storytelling. The game's focus on outdoor safety and nature appreciation is distinct from the time-traveling adventure of Pepper's Adventures in Time, but both games demonstrate Sierra's commitment to creating engaging and informative experiences for players. Mechanically, Slater & Charlie Go Camping builds upon the interactive storybook format, offering a more streamlined and accessible experience for young players.

In terms of gameplay evolution, Slater & Charlie Go Camping lays the groundwork for future educational titles, including Battle Bugs, which would incorporate more complex puzzle mechanics and competitive elements. Although Battle Bugs differs significantly from Slater & Charlie Go Camping in terms of genre and tone, both games showcase Sierra's ability to adapt and innovate within the educational software market. The success of Slater & Charlie Go Camping as an interactive storybook likely influenced the development of subsequent titles, including Battle Bugs, which would go on to become a unique blend of strategy and education.

The narrative and mechanical connections between Slater & Charlie Go Camping and other Sierra titles are largely thematic, with a focus on interactive storytelling and educational content. While the game does not directly influence the plot of Battle Bugs, it contributes to the broader evolution of Sierra's educational offerings, paving the way for more diverse and engaging experiences like Battle Bugs. By exploring different genres and formats, Sierra was able to establish itself as a leader in the educational software market, with titles like Slater & Charlie Go Camping and Battle Bugs representing key milestones in this effort.
