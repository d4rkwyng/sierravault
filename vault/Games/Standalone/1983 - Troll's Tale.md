## Overview

Troll's Tale is a children's adventure game developed by Al Lowe and published by Sierra On-Line in 1983[^ref-1][^ref-2]. Originally created as one of Al Lowe's earliest programming projects, the game was "the third game I ever programmed" according to Lowe himself[^ref-3]. Despite its "incredibly simplistic" appearance by modern standards, Lowe recalls working "a lot of hours on it"[^ref-3]. The game was designed specifically for children, particularly those in 2nd and 3rd grades[^ref-4], and came packaged with a paper map and stickers[^ref-4].

Sierra acquired Troll's Tale from Sunnysoft along with Dragon's Keep and Bop-A-Bet[^ref-5]. The game became notable not only as an early children's adventure title but also as "the inspiration for The Black Cauldron game"[^ref-3], with Disney specifically requesting to use its simplified interface design for their movie tie-in[^ref-3]. Troll's Tale was eventually released as freeware[^ref-6], making it accessible to new generations of players.

## Story Summary

The game's premise centers around an evil troll who has stolen all the treasures belonging to Mark, the Dwarf King[^ref-9][^ref-10]. The player's quest is to locate and recover these hidden treasures, which are described variously as 15 or 16 treasures throughout different sources[^ref-9][^ref-11][^ref-12]. The troll has scattered these valuable items across the fantasy landscape, and only the player can help restore them to their rightful owner[^ref-13].

The adventure culminates when the player confronts the troll directly. In a playful twist typical of children's games, the solution involves pulling the troll's tail, as King Mark (disguised as a guard) declares: "Pull the Troll's Tail and we end the Troll's Tale!"[^ref-14]. This playful pun encapsulates the game's approach—using wordplay and gentle humor to create an engaging experience for young players while teaching basic problem-solving skills. The treasure hunt structure provides clear goals and rewards, encouraging thorough exploration while keeping complexity appropriate for the target audience. The fantasy setting, populated with elves, dwarves, and magical creatures, fires the imagination while remaining accessible to children encountering adventure games for the first time.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Troll's Tale features a deliberately simplified interface designed for young players. Instead of requiring complex text input, the game uses a "simplified Spacebar & Enter key-only interface"[^ref-3] where players choose from three preset options rather than typing commands[^ref-15]. The game employs "minimal typing, spacebar selection, enter to perform actions"[^ref-12], making it accessible to children who might struggle with traditional text adventure parsing.

The parser system is described as "a simple VERB-NOUN type" that "does an adequate job, although the game's vocabulary is quite limited"[^ref-16]. This streamlined approach was intentionally designed to reduce barriers for younger players while maintaining the adventure game experience.

### Structure and Progression

The game can be completed relatively quickly, taking "less than an hour to complete" according to some players[^ref-17], with an average session length of "about a half-hour"[^ref-12]. This brief duration was appropriate for the target age group of children aged "8 and up"[^ref-12]. The game world consists of various locations where the stolen treasures have been hidden, requiring players to explore and solve simple puzzles to recover each item.

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Troll's Tale incorporates "puzzle elements"[^ref-18] appropriate for its young audience. The gameplay focuses on exploration and item collection rather than complex logical challenges. Players navigate through a fantasy setting, searching for the hidden treasures and interacting with various characters and locations using the simplified command system.

The puzzles are designed to be solvable through logical thinking and exploration rather than pixel hunting or obscure item combinations. Players encounter various obstacles that require finding the right item or making the correct choice from the available options. The game rewards thorough exploration, as treasures are scattered throughout the game world in both obvious and hidden locations. Some items must be used in specific ways to progress, teaching young players basic adventure game logic without overwhelming them with complexity.

The inclusion of physical materials reflected the era's approach to children's software, where packaging served both functional and entertainment purposes. The map helped players navigate the game world while the stickers provided additional engagement beyond the screen. These physical components also served as collectibles, with well-preserved original packages now sought by retro gaming enthusiasts. The instruction manual provided age-appropriate guidance for young adventurers, explaining the simplified interface and offering hints for beginning players without spoiling the treasure locations.

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospectives generally acknowledge Troll's Tale as "a charming, early kid's game from Al Lowe, creator of Leisure Suit Larry series"[^ref-16]. Reviewers note that while "Troll's Tale is designed for children in mind, it can be played by adults as well"[^ref-7], though they emphasize its primary appeal to younger audiences. Contemporary assessments recognize it as "a well made adventure, but it is easy and can take less than an hour to complete"[^ref-17].

## Development

### Origins

Al Lowe developed Troll's Tale during his early period at Sierra, when he "learned assembly language at Ken's insistence and wrote a children's adventure game in it"[^ref-15]. The game was created in 1983, before Lowe would go on to create the Leisure Suit Larry series[^ref-5]. Originally, the game was developed by Sunnysoft before being acquired by Sierra On-Line along with other titles[^ref-5].

### Production

The original development team included Al Lowe for programming and text, with Mike MacChesney contributing text and graphics[^ref-3]. For the IBM PCjr version, the credits expanded to include Michael MacChesney as writer, Peter Oliphant for conversion, Doug MacNeill for graphic art, and additional text contributions from Al Lowe, Margaret Lowe, Michael MacChesney, and Rae Lynn MacChesney[^ref-12]. Peter Oliphant was responsible for converting the game to multiple platforms[^ref-5].

A modern recreation was created entirely by Tyler Wright, who handled "art, music, coding, design" for a 2023 version using the Bitsy engine[^ref-20].

### Technical Achievements

Troll's Tale utilized "The Graphics Magician" as its graphics tool[^ref-12], representing an improvement over earlier Sierra Hi-Res Adventures[^ref-5]. The game featured a 320×200 resolution with a "4-color CGA palette"[^ref-12] and "minimal PC speaker sounds"[^ref-12]. The total file size was compact at just "82 kB"[^ref-12], and it was distributed on a "single-sided disk"[^ref-12].

The game used a "Pre-AGI" engine[^ref-7], which was the same engine used for Dragon's Keep[^ref-5]. On the PC port, there was a notable visual quirk where "the logo appears pink and scanlined"[^ref-21]. Despite its technical simplicity, the game managed to create an engaging fantasy atmosphere through its colorful graphics and whimsical character designs.

### Multi-Platform Development

Troll's Tale was released across an impressive range of platforms for its era, demonstrating Sierra's commitment to reaching the widest possible audience. Peter Oliphant was responsible for converting the game to multiple platforms[^ref-5], adapting the graphics and code to work within the limitations of each system. The Apple II version served as the primary development platform, with conversions following for the Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64, ColecoVision, Coleco Adam, and IBM PC/PCjr. Each version maintained the core gameplay while adjusting to platform-specific capabilities, particularly in terms of graphics and sound.

## Legacy

Troll's Tale holds historical significance as both an early example of Sierra's children's adventure games and as the direct inspiration for a major Disney collaboration. As Al Lowe explained, Disney "asked me to do a movie spinoff using its simplified Spacebar & Enter key-only interface"[^ref-3] for The Black Cauldron game. This demonstrates how the game's accessible design influenced later adventure game development and established a template that would prove valuable for reaching younger audiences.

The game also represents an important step in Al Lowe's career progression from early educational titles to his later acclaimed Leisure Suit Larry series[^ref-16]. As part of Sierra's efforts to create "age-appropriate adventure games for younger players"[^ref-5], Troll's Tale helped establish the company's presence in the children's gaming market. The game demonstrated that adventure games could be successfully adapted for younger players without sacrificing the core exploration and problem-solving elements that made the genre appealing.

A modern recreation of Troll's Tale was created by Tyler Wright in 2023 using the Bitsy engine[^ref-20], demonstrating the game's continued appeal to both nostalgic players and indie developers interested in preserving classic gaming experiences. This fan-made version maintains the spirit of the original while updating the presentation for modern platforms.

For Al Lowe personally, Troll's Tale represented a significant learning experience. As "the third game I ever programmed"[^ref-3], it allowed him to develop skills in assembly language programming and game design that would serve him well throughout his career at Sierra. The game's success validated his ability to create engaging software for specific audiences, setting the stage for his later work on more ambitious projects. The fact that the game has been released as freeware[^ref-6] ensures that it remains accessible to anyone interested in exploring this formative period in Sierra's history.
