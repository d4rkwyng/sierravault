## Overview

Shannara is a first-person point-and-click adventure game released in December 1995, based on Terry Brooks' bestselling fantasy novel series of the same name [^ref-1]. Developed by Legend Entertainment and designed by [[Corey Cole]] and [[Lori Ann Cole]]—the celebrated creators of Sierra's Quest for Glory series—the game presents an original story set between the first and second books of Brooks' original trilogy [^ref-2]. The game was developed during what has been called the second "bookware" era of game publishing, when literary properties were frequently adapted into interactive experiences [^ref-3].

The game places players in the role of Jak Ohmsford, the son of Shea Ohmsford (the protagonist of *The Sword of Shannara*), who must unite the various races of the Four Lands to combat the resurrected evil of the Warlock Lord Brona [^ref-4]. Legend Entertainment, a studio celebrated for marrying illustrated graphics with the depth of traditional interactive fiction, brought their expertise in text-heavy adventure games to the Shannara universe [^ref-5]. The lush, colorful SVGA graphics represented a significant leap beyond any of Legend's previous games, though the adventure maintained the studio's signature emphasis on prose and dialogue over animation [^ref-2].

Interestingly, author Terry Brooks himself had virtually no involvement with the game's development. In a later interview, when asked about the game and whether he interacted with the Cole designers, Brooks admitted: "I don't... you know, I don't know anything about it. [laughs]... No, I don't remember a thing" [^ref-6]. This disconnect between the source material's creator and the game developers reflects the sometimes distant relationship between licensed properties and their adaptations during this era.

## Story Summary

The game opens in a time of crisis for the Four Lands. The evil wizard Brona, also known as the Warlock Lord, who was dispersed decades ago by Shea Ohmsford wielding the legendary Sword of Shannara, has returned to wreak revenge upon those who killed him [^ref-4]. The magical druid Allanon arrives to inform Jak Ohmsford—Shea's son—about Brona's return and the dire threat facing all the free peoples of the world [^ref-9].

Jak's quest becomes one of diplomacy as much as adventure. The only way to defeat Brona, besides wielding the legendary Sword of Shannara, is to travel to the lands of the different races populating the world and convince them to put their differences aside and join forces against the common enemy [^ref-10]. This mirrors the novels' recurring theme that "only by uniting could the free Races hope to prevail" [^ref-11]. Jak must recruit allies from the various fantastical races—elves, dwarves, trolls, and others—to band together against the evil warlock [^ref-12].

Throughout his journey, Jak encounters numerous characters drawn from the Shannara novels, including the druid Allanon, King Eventine Elessedil of the Elves, Menion Leah, and the Troll King [^ref-13]. The game features multiple party members who join Jak at various points, including companions such as Shella, Brendel, and Davio, each with their own inventory and abilities [^ref-14]. The story incorporates magical runestones that Jak must collect, riddles he must solve, and challenges that test both his wit and his ability to inspire cooperation among disparate peoples [^ref-15].

The narrative builds toward a climactic confrontation with Brona, but the game notably provides "a significant moral dilemma" that adds depth beyond simple good-versus-evil fantasy tropes [^ref-16]. The game's storyline, while technically original, functions effectively as a sequel to *The Sword of Shannara* while setting the stage for the events of *The Elfstones of Shannara* [^ref-17].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Shannara utilizes a point-and-click interface consistent with Legend Entertainment's other adventure games of the period [^ref-18]. The game is viewed from a first-person perspective, and navigation is done by "jumping" from screen to screen rather than continuous movement [^ref-7]. Unlike LucasArts and Sierra games of the era, Legend's adventures were written in the first person, meaning players don't see the character they are playing on screen [^ref-19].

The interface maintains Legend's signature heavy emphasis on text containing clues and dialogues, with a clean first-person presentation [^ref-20]. Players interact with the environment using a standard point-and-click system with verb commands, inventory management, and conversation trees [^ref-10]. The game uses the same interface as Legend's earlier title *Death Gate* [^ref-21].

### Structure and Progression

The game features several distinct modes of play that players cycle through as the adventure progresses [^ref-14]:

- **Story Mode:** The main adventure interface where players explore locations, examine objects, and interact with characters
- **Combat Mode:** Simplified turn-based fighting encounters against various enemies
- **Map Mode:** A top-down world map for traveling between major locations, similar to Ultima's overworld system [^ref-2]
- **Dream Mode:** Special sequences involving visions and supernatural elements

The game progresses through various regions of the Four Lands as Jak seeks allies and artifacts. Key locations include the various racial kingdoms—Elven lands ruled by Eventine Elessedil, Dwarf territories, Troll strongholds, and human settlements like Tyrsis and Leah [^ref-13]. An estimated play time of 8-10 hours makes this a relatively compact adventure by contemporary standards [^ref-5].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

According to GameSpot's review, "the real soul of Shannara lies in its puzzles" [^ref-22]. The game features inventory-based puzzles, conversation trees, and riddle-solving challenges [^ref-10]. Players must talk extensively with NPCs, including their own party members, to uncover clues—a key design philosophy emphasized in multiple walkthroughs: "Just remember to talk to everybody including the members of your party" [^ref-23].

The game incorporates light role-playing elements, including party members who travel with Jak and have their own inventories and abilities, but lacks a full RPG system with experience points or character advancement [^ref-7]. There are top-down map travel, battles, and stats, but these RPG-like elements are simplified compared to dedicated role-playing games [^ref-9].

Combat is turn-based and, notably, the game manual explicitly advises that "fighting should be avoided if at all possible" [^ref-8]. Multiple reviews echo this sentiment—one reviewer stated players should "AVOID ALL COMBAT when given a choice" [^ref-24], while Cindy Yans noted "you really want to avoid combat at all costs" [^ref-1]. The combat system received criticism for feeling "somewhat lifeless," with player impact limited to general commands like attack, retreat, and defend that "never really deliver the feeling of control that you need in a combat system" [^ref-22]. Characters don't gain experience levels through combat encounters [^ref-25].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

The game received mixed to positive reviews upon release, with critics generally praising its visuals and storytelling while noting its accessibility for newcomers to the adventure genre and its underwhelming combat system.

*PC Gamer US* gave the game a score of 72% in their April 1996 issue [^ref-1]. *Computer Game Review* was more enthusiastic, awarding scores of 89/90/88 in their February 1996 review [^ref-1]. GameSpot rated the game 7 out of 10 (Good), with their staff reviewer noting that "Shannara is an excellent pick for novice users or fans of Mr. Brooks, but experienced players should probably keep looking" [^ref-22]. They praised the presentation: "Combining crisp, realistic graphics and a sparse but powerful soundtrack, Legend has created an atmosphere-filled adventure that is surprisingly evocative considering its medium" [^ref-22].

The *Quandary* adventure game magazine acknowledged the game's mixed qualities: "Perhaps I am being too harsh. Other players may well disagree with my assessment of the puzzles, and there are many components that make up a good game. Shannara does have wonderful graphics, an involving and absorbing story which I enjoyed, and it even provides a significant moral dilemma" [^ref-16].

Not all reviews were favorable. A *Next Generation* reviewer was particularly harsh, claiming the game "fails both as an entry in the Shannara saga and as an adventure game" [^ref-1]. Gordon Aplin's review for metzomagic.com offered a balanced perspective: "The Super VGA graphics are excellent—as we have come to expect from Legend... I still found it to be an entertaining game and well worth playing" [^ref-25].

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospectives have generally positioned Shannara as a competent but unremarkable entry in Legend Entertainment's catalog. Hardcore Gaming 101's retrospective noted that "the world is quite pretty, at least—the lush, colorful SVGA graphics are a huge leap beyond any of Legend's previous games," while concluding that "the result is something remarkably average" [^ref-2].

Multiple sources describe the game as particularly suitable for adventure game beginners. Claire White's MobyGames review stated: "It's easier and more accessible than many adventure games, and a good introduction to the genre" [^ref-19]. A GameFAQs reviewer echoed this: "If you're an experienced adventure gamer, Shannara will give you a pleasant, low-challenge experience with a surprisingly strong story" [^ref-18].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** 72% [^ref-7]
- **Abandonware DOS:** 3.97/5.00 [^ref-16]
- **MyAbandonware:** 4.04/5 [^ref-27]
- **Emuparadise:** 5/5 [^ref-28]
- **GameFAQs User Review:** 9/10 [^ref-18]
- **GameSpot User Review:** 7/10 [^ref-17]

## Development

### Origins

The development of Shannara came during what historians of gaming have termed the second "bookware" era, when publishers frequently sought to adapt popular literary properties into video games [^ref-3]. Legend Entertainment partnered with Random House, Terry Brooks' publisher, to bring the Shannara franchise to interactive media [^ref-3].

The project was helmed by [[Corey Cole]] and [[Lori Ann Cole]], famous for creating Sierra's Quest for Glory series [^ref-29]. This pedigree generated excitement among adventure gaming fans—as one GOG wishlist commenter later noted: "Made by the people who made Quest for Glory. That alone means I'll buy it!" [^ref-30]. However, the Coles approached the material with some skepticism. Corey Cole later admitted: "We considered it a blatant Lord of the Rings copy" [^ref-3]—a criticism that had dogged Brooks' novels since *The Sword of Shannara* was first published in 1977 and "heavily criticized for blatantly ripping off J.R.R. Tolkien" [^ref-2].

Legend Entertainment, founded by Bob Bates and Mike Verdu, had built their reputation on illustrated text adventures before transitioning to full graphic adventures [^ref-9]. Their first pure point-and-click game was *Companions of Xanth* in 1993, and Shannara represented a continuation of their efforts to adapt popular fantasy novels [^ref-9].

### Production

Development of Shannara was handled by multiple studios under Legend Entertainment's direction. FAR Productions and Triton Interactive contributed to the game's development alongside Legend's in-house team [^ref-7]. The project was reportedly "troubled" with communication problems between Legend Entertainment and the Coles during production [^ref-3].

The voice direction was handled by Lori Ann Cole herself [^ref-13], bringing professional direction to the game's extensive voice cast. The game features over 30 characters with voice acting [^ref-4], and almost all characters were drawn from the Shannara novels [^ref-21]. The game was bundled with a copy of *The Sword of Shannara* book in its American release, though the Australian release did not include the novel [^ref-25].

### Technical Achievements

Shannara represented a significant visual advancement for Legend Entertainment. The SVGA graphics were noted as excellent by contemporary reviewers [^ref-25], representing "a huge leap beyond any of Legend's previous games" [^ref-2]. The game used high-resolution SVGA backgrounds that showcased detailed, illustrated artwork [^ref-21].

The audio utilized the AIL/Miles Sound System for music and sound effects [^ref-7]. The game featured a "sparse but powerful soundtrack" that contributed to its atmospheric quality [^ref-22]. Composer George Alistair Sanger, known in the industry as "The Fat Man," provided the musical score [^ref-7].

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

While specific sales figures for Shannara have not been publicly disclosed, the game's release coincided with the Shannara novel series approaching 21 million copies sold worldwide [^ref-32]. The game was re-released in budget editions in 1997 for both US and German markets [^ref-27], suggesting sufficient initial sales to warrant continued distribution.

### Collections

Shannara has not appeared in any official compilation releases. The game remains unavailable on modern digital storefronts like GOG or Steam, which has led to a dedicated community of fans requesting its re-release—the GOG wishlist page for Shannara features comments from enthusiasts hoping to see the game made available [^ref-30].

### Fan Projects

The game is preserved through various abandonware sites and can be played through browser-based DOS emulation on sites like ClassicReload.com [^ref-33] and BestDosGames.com [^ref-5]. The Internet Archive maintains a playable version compatible with AO486 MiSTer FPGA hardware [^ref-34].

### Related Publications

- **The Sword of Shannara** (novel): Bundled with American retail copies of the game [^ref-25]
- **Game Manual:** Included comprehensive gameplay instructions and combat advice [^ref-8]

### Critical Perspective

Shannara occupies an interesting position in adventure gaming history as a meeting point between two creative forces: the respected Quest for Glory designers and a major fantasy literary franchise. The game demonstrates both the potential and limitations of "bookware"—it successfully captures the atmosphere and characters of Brooks' world while struggling to create gameplay that matches the depth of the source material.

The game's design philosophy of accessibility—making puzzles solvable without excessive difficulty and explicitly discouraging combat—represents a conscious choice to broaden the adventure genre's appeal. Claire White's assessment that it serves as "a good introduction to the genre" [^ref-19] reflects this approach, though it came at the cost of challenging experienced adventure gamers.

Legend Entertainment's visual achievement with Shannara showed the studio could compete with larger developers in presentation quality, even if the gameplay remained rooted in their text-adventure heritage. The game stands as one of the final examples of the illustrated adventure style that Legend pioneered before the company shifted focus to other genres in the late 1990s.
