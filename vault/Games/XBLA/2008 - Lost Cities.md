# Lost Cities

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

**Lost Cities** is a digital card game developed by Sierra Online Shanghai (formerly Studio Ch'in) and published by Vivendi Games under the Sierra Online brand for Xbox Live Arcade.[^ref-1] Released on April 23, 2008, the game adapts renowned designer Reiner Knizia's popular two-player card game of the same name to console platforms.[^ref-1]

The game challenged players to mount expeditions to five different lost cities, represented by colored suits of cards. Players had to carefully manage risk and timing while building expeditions that would return a profit rather than a loss.[^ref-1]

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The Xbox 360 interface presents each player's hand clearly along the bottom of the screen, with the five expedition columns displayed prominently.[^ref-1] The controller-based design allows quick card selection and placement, with visual indicators showing legal moves.

The game supports Xbox Live Vision camera for video chat during online matches, adding a social element to competitive play.[^ref-1] Three AI difficulty levels provide scalable challenge for offline practice.

### Core Mechanics

Lost Cities is a two-player card game where each player attempts to mount profitable expeditions to five different lost cities.[^ref-1] Each "suit" represents an expedition and consists of:
- **3 Investment Cards** - Multiply the value of an expedition (but also multiply losses)
- **9 Expedition Cards** - Numbered 2 through 10[^ref-1]

Players are dealt eight cards and take turns either playing a card to an expedition or discarding to one of five discard piles. After playing or discarding, players draw either from the deck or from any discard pile.[^ref-1]

### Scoring System

The scoring mechanic creates tension between risk and reward:[^ref-1]

1. **Base Cost** - Each expedition started automatically costs 20 points
2. **Card Values** - Add the face value of all expedition cards played
3. **Investment Multipliers** - Investment cards multiply the expedition's total (including losses)
4. **Bonuses** - Playing 8 or more cards in an expedition grants a bonus

A well-planned expedition can score significant points, but poorly managed expeditions result in devastating losses—especially when investment cards are involved.[^ref-1]

### Match Structure

Each game consists of three rounds. The round ends when all cards from the deck have been drawn and played. Points accumulate across all three rounds, with the player holding the highest total score winning the game.[^ref-1]

### Multiplayer Features

Lost Cities featured both local AI opponents and online multiplayer through Xbox Live.[^ref-1] The game supported the Xbox Live Vision camera, allowing players to see their opponent during matches.[^ref-1] Leaderboards tracked competitive rankings.

Three AI difficulty levels provided challenges for offline play.[^ref-1]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Lost Cities received generally positive reviews as a faithful adaptation of Knizia's acclaimed card game. Critics praised the clean interface and strategic depth that carried over from the physical game.[^ref-1]

The game was recognized as an excellent choice for fans of the original card game and for players seeking a quick, strategic two-player experience on Xbox Live Arcade.[^ref-1]

### Delisting

Lost Cities has since been removed from the Xbox Live Arcade marketplace and is no longer available for purchase digitally.[^ref-1] This fate befell many XBLA titles as Microsoft transitioned to newer console generations.

## Development

### Origins

Lost Cities was developed by Sierra Online Shanghai, a Chinese development studio that was formally known as Studio Ch'in before being incorporated into Sierra Online's global structure.[^ref-1] The studio specialized in digital adaptations of classic card and board games.

### Production

The development focused on creating an accessible interface for controller-based play while preserving the strategic depth of Knizia's original design. The team implemented online features including leaderboards, multiplayer matchmaking, and Vision camera support.[^ref-1]

### Sierra Online Initiative

Lost Cities was part of Sierra Online's broader XBLA publishing initiative during 2006-2009, which brought established tabletop games to digital platforms. Other Sierra-developed titles in this initiative included Carcassonne and Gin Rummy, both developed by Sierra's internal studios.[^ref-1]

## Legacy

Lost Cities represented Sierra Online Shanghai's contribution to Sierra's casual gaming strategy during the Vivendi era. The game demonstrated that digital adaptations of designer board games could find an audience on console platforms.[^ref-1]

The delisting of Lost Cities, along with many other XBLA titles, highlights the preservation challenges facing digital-only game releases.
