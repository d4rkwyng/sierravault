# Space Quest I: Roger Wilco in the Sarien Encounter

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview
Space Quest I: Roger Wilco in the Sarien Encounter is a 1991 VGA remake of the original 1986 Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter, developed and published by [[Sierra On-Line]] for MS-DOS, Amiga, and Macintosh[^ref-4][^ref-2]. Designed by [[Mark Crowe]] and [[Scott Murphy]], the remake features enhanced 256-color VGA graphics, Sound Blaster support, digitized sounds, and a point-and-click icon interface replacing the original text parser[^ref-4][^ref-3][^ref-5]. The VGA graphics were deliberately drawn in a 1950s B-movie style[^ref-2][^ref-5]. Released on August 20, 1991, some puzzles were changed or replaced with new solutions to accommodate the new interface, and it became possible to skip the arcade sequences[^ref-4][^ref-5]. While marketed aggressively, like the other Sierra VGA remakes of the early 1990s, the game was a commercial disappointment[^ref-3].

## Story Summary
The storyline remains the same as the original 1986 release[^ref-3]. Within the Earnon galaxy, Roger Wilco, a janitor aboard the scientific spaceship Arcada, awakens from an on-duty nap in his broom closet to find that the ship has been boarded and seized by the sinister Sariens[^ref-3]. He soon learns that they have stolen a powerful experimental device called the Star Generator, which could cause untold disaster in their hands[^ref-3].

Acquiring a keycard from a dead crew member's body, Roger flees the ship in an escape pod moments before the Arcada self-destructs[^ref-3]. The pod crash-lands on the planet Kerona, a dry, barren wasteland[^ref-3]. Roger defeats a spider-droid that the Sariens dispatched to eliminate him[^ref-3]. In a cave system near his crash site, he is greeted by a mysterious figure who offers help if he kills a monstrous creature called Orat[^ref-3].

After Roger succeeds in the task, the figure supplies him with a skimmer craft to help him reach the town of Ulence Flats, where he can find a new ship[^ref-3]. Reaching Ulence Flats, Roger gambles on slot machines in a cantina to acquire the money needed to buy a spaceship, along with a navigation droid to pilot it[^ref-3]. During this time, he learns from a bar customer the location of the Sariens' spaceship, the Deltaur[^ref-3].

Roger boards the Deltaur and secures a Sarien disguise[^ref-3]. He programs the Star Generator to self-destruct and escapes the ship just before it explodes[^ref-3]. At the end of the game, Roger's efforts are rewarded when he receives the Golden Mop as a token of eternal gratitude from the people of Xenon[^ref-3].

## Gameplay

The remake uses Sierra's SCI game engine with a point-and-click interface and icons along the top of the screen, replacing the AGI engine's text parser[^ref-4]. The new version features enhanced graphics (256-color VGA) and Sound Blaster support[^ref-4].

### Interface and Controls
- Point-and-click interface with icons along the top of the screen[^ref-4][^ref-5]
- No longer requires typing commands; players can interact using mouse-driven icons[^ref-2]
- The text parser is completely replaced by the icon interface[^ref-4]
- Mouse support for movement and interaction[^ref-2]
- Introduces "Smell" and "Taste" icons alongside standard Walk, Use, and Talk—these have no practical use but provoke humorous responses[^ref-30]

### Structure and Progression
- The game takes place across the same locations as the original: the Arcada spaceship, the desert planet Kerona, the town of Ulence Flats, and the Sarien ship Deltaur[^ref-3]
- It is possible to skip the arcade sequences[^ref-4]
- Several additional scenes and more elaborate text descriptions enhance the humorous effect[^ref-4]

### Puzzles and Mechanics
- Some puzzles have been slightly changed to accommodate the new interface[^ref-4]
- As a form of copy protection, coordinates in the VGA version while in the escape pod and the rocket purchased at Tiny's Used Spaceships are only found in the manual[^ref-18][^ref-5]
- The code for retrieving the cartridge aboard the Arcada can only be found in the manual[^ref-18]
- Maximum score is 201 points in VGA (vs 202 in EGA)[^ref-19]
- **VGA-exclusive actions:** Get widget, get plant, use plant on grate monster, leave Deltaur airlock, get ID card—these replaced several EGA-only actions like lifting the platform and kicking the dead body[^ref-19]
- **VGA-exclusive items:** A magnet on the Arcada's Star Generator base and extra cash hidden in bar dust are unique to the VGA version; the magnet can be used on the Slots-o-Death machine to win consistently[^ref-17]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews
Dragon Magazine (January 1992) praised the redesigned VGA version, noting the upgraded 256-color graphics, improved point-and-click interface, better music, and digitized speech, concluding: "The game plays far better than before and is highly enjoyable, richly deserving its fame"[^ref-35]. Writing for VideoGames & Computer Entertainment, Arnie Katz noted that the game "benefited from a recent face-lift," adding: "The graphics are much better, and the point-and-click interface makes play easier than the parser-driven original"[^ref-32].

Despite positive reviews, the game did not sell well commercially[^ref-3]. Like the other Sierra VGA remakes released around the same time (King's Quest I, Police Quest I, Leisure Suit Larry I), the games were marketed very aggressively but "all of these remakes flopped"[^ref-3].

### Modern Assessment
Retro Freak Reviews recommended the remake over the original, stating that the humor, art, animation, and music were improved[^ref-33]. The game holds a MobyScore of 7.4/10 with 70% positive critic reviews and ratings from 67 players[^ref-4]. On GOG, the Space Quest 1+2+3 collection has a 4.3/5 rating[^ref-7]. My Abandonware users rate it 4.49/5 from 45 votes[^ref-2]. HowLongToBeat reports the main story takes approximately 3 hours to complete[^ref-8].

- **MobyGames:** 7.4/10 MobyScore, 70% critics (67 player ratings)[^ref-4]
- **GOG:** 4.3/5 (collection)[^ref-7]
- **Steam:** Very Positive (312 reviews, collection)[^ref-9]
- **GameFAQs:** 3.69/5 (68 ratings)[^ref-26]
- **HowLongToBeat:** 3 hours main story[^ref-8]

## Development

### Origins
Around 1990-1991, Sierra began releasing VGA remakes of their mid-1980s hits using the new SCI gaming system[^ref-3]. This offered them a chance to try out the new engine, and among these releases were Leisure Suit Larry I, King's Quest I, Police Quest I, and Space Quest I[^ref-3].

Space Quest I was given an overhaul when it was remade using Sierra's SCI language, which allowed the game to upgrade from its original EGA graphics to VGA[^ref-5]. The VGA graphics were drawn deliberately in a 1950s B-movie style[^ref-2][^ref-5]. Scott Murphy later admitted he had little say in the art direction: "The VGA art designer wanted an old fashioned space movie look. It sounded good in theory but wasn't executed as was advertised"[^ref-16]. Much of the artwork was outsourced to Korea—Murphy jokingly blamed "The Simpsons" for this industry trend[^ref-16]. In addition to the new graphics, it featured digitized sounds and an icon interface[^ref-5].

The VGA remake was developed behind Murphy and Crowe's backs while they were working on Space Quest IV[^ref-27]. Despite their limited involvement, both are officially credited as "Game Designers" in the final product—a common practice for remakes crediting original creators[^ref-31]. The actual creative lead was Douglas Herring, credited as both Director and Art Designer, who determined the visual direction[^ref-31]. When Murphy and Crowe requested changes—Murphy openly disliked the "Jetsons-esque" redesigns of some areas—they were told it was too late to make alterations[^ref-27]. Roger Wilco's hair color was also changed from brown to blond in this version[^ref-27]. An earlier plan for the original AGI version would have allowed players to choose a female version of Roger, but this was cut due to lack of sprite space and demographic considerations[^ref-27].

Several of the puzzles from the original game were changed or replaced with new solutions[^ref-5]. Fans are sharply divided between which version of the game they prefer: many enjoy the rich graphical layout of the 1991 remake, while others appreciate the historical purity of the original[^ref-5].

The game was released in both VGA and a rare EGA version based on the VGA version, and a 32-color Amiga version[^ref-5]. Ken Allen composed the music for the remake[^ref-4].

### Technical Achievements
- Used Sierra's SCI engine with 256-color VGA graphics[^ref-3][^ref-4]
- Point-and-click icon interface replacing the text parser[^ref-4][^ref-5]
- Sound Blaster support and digitized sounds[^ref-4]
- 1950s B-movie art style for all graphics[^ref-2][^ref-5]
- Additional scenes and more elaborate text descriptions[^ref-4]
- Platform releases: August 20, 1991 MS-DOS, 1991 Amiga, 1992 Macintosh[^ref-4][^ref-5]
- **System requirements:** 286 CPU, 640KB RAM, DOS 5.0, 6MB hard drive, VGA/MCGA graphics; sound support for AdLib, Sound Blaster, Roland MT-32, Pro Audio Spectrum, Game Blaster, and PC Speaker; General MIDI support via patch[^ref-20][^ref-28]
- **Original media:** Five 5.25" or four 3.5" floppy disks; later Kixx re-release on CD-ROM[^ref-28]
- **Localization:** A Spanish/English bilingual version was also released[^ref-12]
- Fully supported in ScummVM since version 1.2.0; runs on SCI engine at 320x200 resolution with 256 colors[^ref-21]
- The Amiga version used an extended color palette compared to other platforms[^ref-21]
- **Speed bugs on modern systems:** The acid rain sequence in Kerona cave, desert dehydration timer, and Spider Droid arrival all run too fast; official Sierra patches fix memory and SoundBlaster initialization issues, while NewRisingSun patches address timing bugs[^ref-12][^ref-20]

### Easter Eggs and Trivia
- **King Graham cameo:** In the VGA ending sequence, King Graham from King's Quest appears to award Roger the Golden Mop—a crossover between Sierra's flagship franchises[^ref-17]
- **ZZ Top legal issue:** The game originally featured a band resembling ZZ Top, but legal concerns from the band's lawyers forced Sierra to change it—the modified version shows the band running away as soon as Roger enters the scene; removing all `*.v56` files restores the original sprites[^ref-17][^ref-20]
- **Latex Babe easter egg:** Using the TONGUE icon on the purple spiral above the doorway after obtaining the Sarien uniform triggers a glitchy Latex Babe animation[^ref-22]
- **Wrong coordinates easter eggs:** Pressing the "DO NOT TOUCH" button in the escape pod transports Roger to Nottingham Castle from Conquests of the Longbow (fatal)—the EGA version sent players to Daventry Castle from King's Quest I instead; entering wrong coordinates can crash-land Roger at King's Quest castle with moat alligators and dialogue from Roberta and Ken Williams[^ref-23][^ref-26][^ref-30]
- **Instant replay death:** One VGA death scene features the Two Guys from Andromeda popping up to announce an instant replay of Roger's particularly stupid moment[^ref-30]
- **Sci-fi references:** The Deltaur attack sequence mirrors the Death Star assault from Star Wars; the Sarien Spider Droid is based on the Imperial Scout Droid from The Empire Strikes Back; Kerona's hologram theme mimics 2001: A Space Odyssey's iconic music[^ref-22]
- **Cameos:** Robbie the Robot from "Forbidden Planet" works as the store droid; a Star Trek Warbird appears when selecting wrong coordinates; the time pod from Space Quest IV appears when leaving Ulence Flats; Blues Brothers and Madonna appear in the bar[^ref-17]
- **Hitchhiker's Guide references:** The triple-breasted hooker from Eroticon VI sits at the Ulence Flats bar; the arms dealer on the Sarien ship sounds like Marvin the Paranoid Android[^ref-29][^ref-30]
- **Hayao Miyazaki reference:** The robot shop features "Hay-A-O," a creature resembling characters from Laputa: Castle in the Sky, named after director Hayao Miyazaki[^ref-30]
- **Droids-B-Us parodies:** The store features Dalek robots (Doctor Who), Maximillian (The Black Hole), Huey (Silent Running), and the Lost in Space babysitter droid; Sierra won the Toys-R-Us lawsuit over this parody[^ref-5][^ref-17]
- **Sierra crossover:** A Sarien guard mentions King's Quest II and III, with bonus points awarded for confirming you own KQ2[^ref-22]
- **Dev trivia:** Kerona was named after Corona beer, the developers' preferred drink in 1986; manual credits Scott Murphy as director despite him not working on the VGA remake[^ref-22][^ref-23]
- **Feelies:** The original AGI game included physical coupons for the Rocket Bar and Droids-B-Us; in the VGA remake, these are reworked as an extra reward alongside the jetpack offer[^ref-27]

## Legacy

Although the remake received positive reviews, it was a commercial disappointment like the other Sierra VGA remakes of the era[^ref-3]. According to Sierra On-Line's SEC filing, combined sales of the Space Quest series surpassed 1.2 million units by the end of March 1996[^ref-34].

In 1992, Adventure Comics (a division of Malibu Graphics) published a three-issue comic series titled "The Adventures of Roger Wilco" based on the original game's plot, with issues released in February, April, and May 1992[^ref-36]. The VGA remake established the visual style that would be carried forward in Space Quest IV, which was released in the same year and featured similar 256-color graphics[^ref-4].
