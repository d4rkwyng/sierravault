# Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 2, 2026</small>

## Overview
Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers is a graphic adventure game developed and published by [[Sierra On-Line]], released in March 1991 for MS-DOS with subsequent ports to Windows, Macintosh, Amiga, and PC-98[^ref-6][^ref-2]. Designed by [[Mark Crowe]] and [[Scott Murphy]], the game is the fourth installment in the Space Quest series and the first to feature Sierra's icon-based point-and-click SCI interface and 256-color VGA graphics[^ref-3][^ref-6]. The game was released on floppy disks in March 1991 and later re-released on CD-ROM in December 1992 with full speech support, featuring Laugh-In announcer Gary Owens as the narrator[^ref-4][^ref-32]. The game cost over $1,000,000 to produce but was a commercial success, selling more copies than all three previous Space Quest games combined[^ref-4][^ref-5]. It was one of the first games to use motion capture animation and featured video-captured animation[^ref-3][^ref-4].

## Story Summary
Following the events of Space Quest III, lowly janitor Roger Wilco is heading back to his homeworld of Xenon aboard the Aluminum Mallard[^ref-5]. Stopping at a bar for drinks and retelling his heroics to the customers, Roger is approached by two androids[^ref-5]. Taken outside, they reveal themselves to be under the employment of Sludge Vohaul, the villain of Space Quest II, who has been reborn in the future and is seeking revenge[^ref-4][^ref-5].

Before the androids kill him, two soldiers rescue Roger, one of whom opens a rift in time and instructs him to escape through it[^ref-5]. Travelling through the rift, Roger winds up on Xenon in the near future, devastated by a major disaster—in what the game claims is "Space Quest XII: Vohaul's Revenge II"[^ref-4][^ref-5].

Exploring the ruins of the planet's main city, Roger finds a recording revealing that Xenon developed an AI supercomputer to run everything, but it was infected with a virus—Vohaul's mind digitized—that waged war on the inhabitants, killing or enslaving most of the population[^ref-5]. Finding he must stop Vohaul, Roger sneaks a ride to Vohaul's base and steals a time-travel ship[^ref-5].

Taking himself back several years, he winds up on the Planet Estros during "Space Quest X: Latex Babes of Estros"—a parody of Infocom's Leather Goddesses of Phobos—where he encounters his future ex-girlfriend[^ref-5]. After rescuing her from trouble, Roger joins them on a shopping trip, acquiring items to assist in his quest[^ref-5]. Roger also visits Space Quest I, where the graphics and music become retro and he is threatened by a group of monochrome bikers who consider Roger's 256 colors pretentious[^ref-5].

Infiltrating Vohaul's base, Roger discovers the true identity of the soldier who rescued him[^ref-5]. After initiating the supercomputer's reformatting process, Roger confronts Vohaul, defeats him, and liberates Xenon once again[^ref-5].

> [!warning]- Plot Spoiler - Character Identity
> The soldier who rescued Roger is actually his son from the future. Vohaul captured him, and Roger must rescue him before returning to the present. His son provides only minor details about his future before they part ways[^ref-5].

## Gameplay

Space Quest IV was developed using Sierra's SCI engine with 256-color hand-painted graphics, representing a significant visual upgrade from previous entries[^ref-3][^ref-4]. It was one of the first games ever with video-captured animation[^ref-3].

### Interface and Controls
- In contrast to the first three games, Space Quest IV uses a point-and-click interface similar to King's Quest V[^ref-3][^ref-6]
- Actions include icons for walking, looking, using/picking up, talking, smelling, and tasting (the latter two mainly for comedic purposes)[^ref-6]
- Objects can be examined in the inventory and selected as actions to use in environments[^ref-6]
- Designer Scott Murphy preferred keeping the original parser interface, believing it added depth, but management overruled this decision to maintain consistency across Sierra's modern games[^ref-31]

### Structure and Progression
- The game features time travel through multiple "Space Quest" eras, including the dystopian future of "Space Quest XII," "Space Quest X: Latex Babes of Estros," and the original Space Quest I[^ref-4][^ref-5]
- Features scrolling screens—a first for Sierra games at the time[^ref-4]
- Like other Sierra games, players must deal with deadly situations quickly to avoid game over sequences[^ref-35]

### Puzzles and Mechanics
- Ms. Astro Chicken: Flight of the Pullet is an embedded minigame in the Latex Babes of Estros portion, appearing in a mall arcade[^ref-3]
- The minigame is a sequel to Astro Chicken from Space Quest III and parodies Ms. Pac-Man[^ref-3]
- Players control a flying chicken whose enemies include flying squirrels, windpumps, shotgun-wielding hunters, and hunting dogs[^ref-3]
- The arcade cabinet eventually explodes, though this has no effect on the broader game[^ref-3]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews
Dragon Magazine (September 1991) praised the game's "brilliant" humor and "meticulous" attention to detail, calling the animation and music "amazing" and concluding "Space Quest IV is a great addition to a great series of games"[^ref-44]. Computer Gaming World's Charles Ardai stated in 1993 that "the CD-ROM version is even more filling than the original. It accentuates and improves all of the game's strong points," with voice actors providing much better performances than in King's Quest V[^ref-39].

While noting that the CD-ROM did not change the brevity of the gameplay, Ardai added: "There are better adventure games than Space Quest IV [but] there are few games that are more entertaining. Fewer still are improved so much in the transition to CD-ROM"[^ref-39]. He concluded that "Space Quest IV is the perfect multimedia game: it looks and sounds great and it offers an experience one could not get from a floppy-based game"[^ref-39].

In April 1994, Computer Gaming World said the CD version's voices "bring Roger Wilco's campy world to life... one of his finest and funniest adventures"[^ref-40]. Jim Trunzo reviewed the game in White Wolf #30 (1992), rating it 4 out of 5, stating: "The game's comedic bent camouflages the underlying tenseness of the conflict between the good guys and the bad guys. Great futuristic graphics blend perfectly with the simplified game play to make Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers one of life's rare creatures - a successful sequel"[^ref-1].

The Amiga release was not as well received, with some reviewers citing poor quality of the conversion and some Amiga magazines grading it as low as 19%[^ref-1].

### Modern Assessment
In 1996, Computer Gaming World ranked Space Quest IV as #1 on its "15 Funniest Games Of All Time" list, writing that it "transformed every sci-fi time-travel cliche with Gary Owens' voice... providing the perfect comedic counterpoint"[^ref-41]. In 2011, Adventure Gamers named Space Quest IV the 48th-best adventure game ever released[^ref-43].

The game holds a MobyScore of 7.5/10 with 69% positive critic reviews and ratings from 127 players[^ref-6]. On GOG, the Space Quest 4+5+6 collection has a 4.3/5 rating[^ref-7]. My Abandonware users rate it 4.53/5 from 69 votes[^ref-8]. HowLongToBeat reports the main story takes approximately 4.6 hours to complete[^ref-9].

## Development

### Origins
Space Quest IV was developed using 256-color hand-painted graphics and was one of the first games ever to use motion capture animation[^ref-3][^ref-4][^ref-31]. The overall cost of the game was far greater than previous titles, exceeding $1,000,000—making it comparable to King's Quest V, which was Sierra's first million-dollar-plus production effort according to the King's Quest Collection Series manual[^ref-3][^ref-4].

The game was released originally on six high-density floppy disks in March 1991 and later re-released on CD-ROM in December 1992 with full speech support[^ref-3][^ref-4]. The CD-ROM version featured voices from Sierra employees, except the narrator Gary Owens—a legendary voice actor with over 30,000 voice-over jobs including Roger Ramjet and Space Ghost[^ref-3][^ref-36]. Notable voice cast included Jeff Bender as Roger Wilco, Scott Murphy himself as Sludge Vohaul, Josh Mandel as the Monolith Burger Manager, and future Gabriel Knight designer Jane Jensen as Maebot[^ref-38]. When writing narrator lines, Scott Murphy always imagined Gary Owens speaking them; signing Owens was "a dream come true"[^ref-36]. Murphy later stated Owens was "a living legend in the entertainment biz whom we were both extremely privileged to have had the opportunity to work with"[^ref-37]. Scott Murphy later revealed that the CD-ROM version was not authorized by the Two Guys—neither designer worked on it, having moved onto other projects, and other developers implemented modifications to areas like Galaxy Galleria[^ref-31]. An Atari ST version was announced via Sierra News Magazine but was later canceled[^ref-4].

Space Quest IV pioneered the use of digitally scanned artwork for backgrounds—the only game in the series to use this technique[^ref-31]. While Roger remained a bitmap-animated character, environments were created from acrylic paintings scanned into computer memory. Roger's sprite was constructed within a 33×16-18 square grid, with animators creating hundreds of individual frames to simulate movement[^ref-31]. Developers organized rooms using 16 priority bands (horizontal grid divisions) to control object placement and character movement[^ref-31].

The original game came with: a box, six 3.5" game disks (seven for Macintosh), Sierra game manual, Space Piston Magazine booklet, optional hint book for $9.95, Sierra games catalogue, and several leaflets from third-party companies[^ref-3]. The game was originally sold for $59.95[^ref-3].

Josh Mandel, then a producer at Sierra eager to contribute creatively, wrote significant portions of the game's text including the Bargain Bin descriptions, Radio Shock online catalog, fake Hintbook text, and look messages for locations on Xenon, Estros, and the Galaxy Galleria[^ref-17]. According to Mandel, "Sierra's lawyer would break out in an icy sweat every time he entered the SQ area" due to the team's freewheeling approach to parody[^ref-17].

In a 2015 interview, designer Mark Crowe reflected on design decisions he regretted: "The most egregious one that comes to mind is the infamous Sequel Police at the Galaxy Galleria. That was just plain dumb"[^ref-20].

- **Time pod debug patch:** A modern fan patch allows instant travel between game eras without original debug codes[^ref-29]

### Easter Eggs and Trivia
- **Secret Ortega time code:** Entering a specific sequence (top row left to right, then leftmost symbol of second row) in a timepod transports Roger to the surface of Ortega from Space Quest III; a death message parodies the "This is your brain on drugs" PSA[^ref-23][^ref-25]
- **"I Love Lunacy" easter egg:** A different timepod code briefly transforms Roger into "electronic entrails of some long-lost civilization" displaying the message[^ref-23]
- **Hidden QA credits:** Looking at the unreadable sign in the bar staircase five times reveals full Quality Assurance credits (floppy version only)[^ref-25]
- **Bob Andrews cameo:** Former Sierra programmer Bob Andrews occasionally appears at the Galaxy Galleria's Big and Tall store "rummaging around, occasionally pulling out a pair of red shorts"[^ref-25]
- **King Graham carried by condor:** In the pterodactyl's nest on Estros, King Graham from King's Quest can be seen being carried by the once-starving eagle from KQ5[^ref-22][^ref-25]
- **Cedric the Owl target:** In Ms. Astro Chicken (Windows CD version only), Cedric from King's Quest V occasionally flies by; hitting him awards 50 bonus points[^ref-25]
- **Luke Skywalker's speeder:** The crashed hovercraft on Xenon streets is Luke's red speeder from Star Wars in disguise[^ref-25]
- **Get Smart reference:** A trash can in the Arcade functions as one of the agents from the TV series when addressed[^ref-25]
- **Droids-B-Us lawsuit:** Smelling the back of Droids-B-Us at Ulence Flats triggers: "Smells like another lawsuit coming back to haunt the Two Guys from Andromeda"—referencing the Toys-R-Us lawsuit from SQ1[^ref-25]
- **Two Geeks signing:** When first visiting Software Excess, the bouncer mentions the Two Geeks From Andromeda are inside signing copies of their latest release[^ref-25]
- **Meta hint book:** The bargain bin at Software Excess contains a hint book for Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers—the very game you're playing[^ref-25]
- **Energizer Bunny parody:** Sierra obtained verbal permission from Eveready for the bunny parody, proceeding based on parody protections[^ref-24]
- **CD-ROM typo:** The Multimedia PC CD-ROM edge contains a typo: "trademards" instead of "trademarks"[^ref-24]

### Pop Culture Spoofs
- **Star Wars:** Zondra's "Into the sub, flyboy" parodies Leia's "Into the garbage chute, flyboy"; Imperial ProBots appear in the SuperComputer; Jebba the Hop spoofs Jabba the Hutt[^ref-23][^ref-25]
- **2001: A Space Odyssey:** Admiral Toolman throws Roger's underpants into the air, transforming into the DeepShip 86—parodying the bone-to-spaceship transition[^ref-25]
- **Alien/H.R. Giger:** The Super Computer's interior artwork resembles Giger's biomechanical alien ship designs[^ref-23]
- **Twin Peaks:** A hint book question references "the one-armed man" with the answer "Ask Bob"[^ref-23]
- **Software store parodies:** "Boom" (Loom), "It Came For Dessert" (It Came from the Desert), "Sim Sim" (Maxis games), "Where in the World is Hymie Lipschitz" (Carmen Sandiego), "Cluck Egger" (Chuck Yeager's Flight Simulator), "Hz So Good" (Hertz rental)[^ref-23][^ref-25]
- **King's Quest XXXXVIII:** The bargain bin contains "King's Quest XXXXVIII by Roberta Williams III"[^ref-25]

### Cut Content
- **Dacron Danny:** A bargain bin item removed from Software Excess; the recorded description called it "a character so offensive, so sexually inept, and so lame-brained"—a parody of Leisure Suit Larry[^ref-26]
- **Stunt Flyer:** Another bargain bin program that was cut from the final game[^ref-26]
- **Hidden KQ6 room:** An unused room discovered in source code via SCI Studio containing removed references to ZZ Top, the original Droids'R'Us logo, Hero Quest banner (renamed Quest for Glory), the Dinosaurs TV series character, and "Radio Shock" signage (changed to "Hz So Good" in CD-ROM)[^ref-26]
- **Unused audio:** Multiple sound fragments exist in resource files that weren't incorporated into the final game[^ref-26]
- **Roger's original design:** Early artwork showed Roger with a white shirt and purple sleeves; the final version unified his clothing colors[^ref-31]
- **Alternate title screen:** An earlier title screen appeared in 1990 promotional materials; the EGA conversion preserved the original design[^ref-31]

### Bugs and Compatibility
- **Error 47:** The most notorious bug in the Space Quest series—the game crashes at the ComPost terminal in Sickbay with "Error 47: Not an object: $0 script 64994/$f29"[^ref-33]
- **Non-responsive NPCs:** A bug prevents Blaine Rohmer (the endodroid runner) and Elmo from responding to dialogue; normally talking to them twice works, but Roger only says "Hey" and they walk away[^ref-33]
- **Animation glitches:** On fast systems, the droid in the hallway "rushes by at the speed of light" and Roger appears to be "headbanging" instead of looking around[^ref-33]
- **Format countdown too fast:** The supercomputer formatting sequence runs unthrottled, not giving players time to escape; adjusting the in-game speed slider can help[^ref-33][^ref-34]
- **File not found errors:** "992.v56 not found" or "993.V56 not found" errors occur when running SCIDHUV.EXE directly instead of SQ4.BAT[^ref-34]
- **Sound issues:** NT-based Windows systems require VDMSound to emulate Sound Blaster; Windows version users should change "synthtype=basesynth" to "synthtype=highsynth" in sierra.ini for proper music[^ref-34]
- **ScummVM recommended:** ScummVM (since v1.4.1) resolves most known issues including timer bugs; NewRisingSun patches also address timing problems for DOSBox users[^ref-33][^ref-34]
- **Point bell glitch (CD-ROM):** A bug prevents triggering the 3-point award when Roger changes back into his space uniform, leaving players with 312/315 points; keeping the unstable ordinance allows an alternate 332/315 maximum[^ref-38]

## Legacy

According to Sierra On-Line's SEC filing, combined sales of the Space Quest series surpassed 1.2 million units by the end of March 1996[^ref-42]. Space Quest IV was an instant success, selling more copies than all three previous Space Quest games combined[^ref-3][^ref-4].

After Space Quest IV, Mark Crowe went to work for Sierra subsidiary Dynamix in Eugene, Oregon, where he produced Space Quest V without Scott Murphy's assistance[^ref-11]. The game's self-referential humor—with Roger traveling through his own past and future sequels—became one of the series' most beloved elements[^ref-5].

### Collections

This game has been included in the following collections:
- Space Quest: Collector's Edition (a.k.a. Roger Wilco Unclogged)[^ref-2]
- Space Quest Saga (The)[^ref-2]
- [Space Quest Collection (XP)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/10110)[^ref-2][^ref-10]
- Space Quest: Collection Series[^ref-2]
- [Space Quest 4+5+6](https://www.gog.com/en/game/space_quest_4_5_6)[^ref-7]

### Amiga Port & SCP Enhancement

Sierra's original Amiga port of Space Quest IV was widely considered one of the worst conversions in the company's history. The SCI engine's Amiga implementation used a single color palette for the entire game, resulting in graphics that poorly translated the DOS VGA visuals. Some Amiga magazines rated the port as low as 19%, with fans describing it as a "daft excuse for a port."[^ref-1][^ref-46]

In December 2025, the [[2025 - SCP Sierra Conversion Project|Sierra Conversion Project (SCP)]]—a Spanish fan group led by DaRaSCo—released an enhanced OCS version that reconstructs the palette and graphics.[^ref-46] DaRaSCo spent considerable time finding a more consistent palette that works across all game screens while maintaining the spirit of the original DOS VGA graphics. The enhancement also includes MIDI support via Roland MT-32.[^ref-46]
