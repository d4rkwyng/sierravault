# Space Quest V: The Next Mutation

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview
Space Quest V: Roger Wilco – The Next Mutation is a graphic adventure game developed by [[Dynamix]] and published by [[Sierra On-Line]], released on February 5, 1993 for MS-DOS[^ref-5][^ref-18]. Designed by [[Mark Crowe]], this was the first Space Quest game to be developed outside of Sierra On-Line proper, and the first not designed by both "Two Guys from Andromeda" as only Crowe worked on the project[^ref-18][^ref-3]. Set within a spoof of the Star Trek franchise, the story focuses on Roger Wilco finally achieving his dream of becoming a star captain, only to become involved in saving the galaxy from a deadly threat posed by a man-made virus[^ref-5][^ref-18]. The game was released on floppy disk only; early plans for a CD-ROM "talkie" version were cancelled because Dynamix was in financial trouble and eager to release new games rather than work on enhanced versions of already-released titles[^ref-4][^ref-3].

## Story Summary
Following the events of Space Quest IV, lowly janitor Roger Wilco applies for a place at Starcon Academy, hoping to become a captain on his own ship[^ref-18]. While at the Academy, Roger makes an enemy of Raems T. Quirk—a toupee-wearing commander in charge of Starcon's most prized ship, the SCS Goliath, and a rather blatant spoof of Captain James T. Kirk[^ref-18][^ref-2].

During an aptitude test, which Roger cheats through, Starcon is visited by Ambassador Beatrice Wankmeister—the very woman Roger is set to have a relationship with, after learning of her from his future son in Space Quest IV[^ref-18]. Beatrice requests an escort to investigate bizarre cases of toxic dumping across the galaxy; Quirk offers to assist her using the Goliath[^ref-5]. Meanwhile, Roger successfully achieves his dream and is given command of his own ship, the garbage scow SCS Eureka, which looks and functions like an oversized vacuum cleaner[^ref-5][^ref-2].

Working alongside his crew, the Eureka works to clean up rubbish, picking up a facehugger creature that Roger takes on as a pet[^ref-5]. They also intercept a transmission on a Starcon frequency concerning a collection from an unknown figure[^ref-2]. After collecting rubbish in orbit over a jungle planet, the Eureka comes under attack by a homicidal gynoid named WD40, sent by the same company that came after Roger in Space Quest III[^ref-18].

When the crew take a moment to relax at a "space bar," Roger finds his chief engineer Cliffy—a parody of Scotty from Star Trek—engaged in a bar brawl with some of the Goliath's crew[^ref-2]. Quirk arrests Cliffy, forcing Roger to break him out[^ref-2]. Later, Roger investigates a colony and finds the colonists have become mutants; a canister found nearby belongs to a genetics company, and a log entry reveals the colony was attacked after being visited by the Goliath[^ref-5].

The Eureka receives an SOS from Quirk revealing his ship is under attack by mutants[^ref-2]. Responding, the crew find an escape pod containing Beatrice, who reveals the ship was hit by mutants and that Quirk and the crew were mutated as a result[^ref-5]. Roger puts her into cryo-sleep to slow her own mutation until he can find a cure[^ref-2]. Tracking down the genetics company, Roger discovers scientists created a terraforming virus that mutated and started attacking living creatures[^ref-5]. The experiment was ended, but the lead scientist had Quirk bribed to dump the vats of virus around the galaxy[^ref-2]. Roger ultimately defeats Quirk, cures Beatrice, and saves the galaxy once again[^ref-18].

## Gameplay

Space Quest V was developed using Sierra Creative Interpreter 1.1 (SCI1.1), featuring 256-color VGA graphics[^ref-3][^ref-4]. The game continues the point-and-click interface introduced in Space Quest IV.

### Interface and Controls
- Uses the same point-and-click icon interface as Space Quest IV[^ref-2]
- The game features a command bridge where Roger can give orders to his crew[^ref-5]
- Commands include interactions with officers, such as "activate cloaking device"[^ref-17]
- No voice acting—the game was released on floppy disk only[^ref-18][^ref-3]

### Structure and Progression
- Roger commands the SCS Eureka and manages a crew of officers throughout the game[^ref-5][^ref-2]
- The game takes place across multiple locations including Starcon Academy, various planets, the "space bar," and the genetics company facility[^ref-5]
- Players collect garbage at various stops while uncovering the conspiracy[^ref-18]

### Puzzles and Mechanics
- Inventory-based puzzle solving typical of Sierra adventures[^ref-5]
- The game features extensive parody of Star Trek, including crew dynamics and ship operations[^ref-18][^ref-2]
- Roger can interact with his pet facehugger creature found in the garbage[^ref-5]
- Features product placement for Sprint, appearing in communications transmissions, on a billboard in the Spacebar, and in the ending credits[^ref-18]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews
Charles Ardai in Computer Gaming World (June 1993) stated that the game was "not just funny" but also "exciting and suspenseful, due in large part to its movie-quality score, its atmosphere-enhancing sound effects, and its remarkable visuals"[^ref-17]. He praised "the high-adventure plot, and the first-rate graphics and sound" and described the dialogue and narration as "written with a dry wit and a sense of character that makes them a pleasure to read"[^ref-17]. Ardai concluded "I think even the most demanding Wilcophiles will be pleased"[^ref-17].

The game was welcomed by critics as a fun addition to the series, although it did not feature a voice-cast version as with Space Quest IV[^ref-18]. The absence of Scott Murphy from the design team was noted as resulting in a "somewhat altered sense of humor"[^ref-20].

### Modern Assessment
Adventure Gamers rated the game "Very good," calling it "an impressive attempt to move the series into the next generation" with "the best story and characters of the series so far"[^ref-31]. The review praised the "colorful and interesting locations" and "variety of well-crafted puzzles," while noting the lack of voice acting and "one of the worst mazes ever" as negatives[^ref-31]. The site estimated completion time at 6-8 hours, calling it "the lengthiest in the series so far"[^ref-31].

The game holds a MobyScore of 8.1/10 with 82% positive critic reviews and ratings from 88 players[^ref-5]. On GOG, the Space Quest 4+5+6 collection has a 4.3/5 rating[^ref-6]. My Abandonware users rate it 4.6/5 from 62 votes[^ref-7]. HowLongToBeat reports the main story takes approximately 5.9 hours to complete[^ref-8].

- **Adventure Gamers:** "Very good" – best story/characters, improved graphics, challenging maze[^ref-31]
- **MobyGames:** 8.1/10 MobyScore, 82% critics (88 player ratings)[^ref-5]
- **GOG:** 4.3/5 (collection)[^ref-6]
- **Steam:** Very Positive (312 reviews, collection)[^ref-9]
- **HowLongToBeat:** 5.9 hours main story[^ref-8]

## Development

### Origins
In 1991, Mark Crowe relocated to Eugene, Oregon when his wife got a job there, and he transferred from Sierra's Oakhurst headquarters to the Dynamix subsidiary[^ref-16]. According to Crowe: "SQ4 had been a particularly stressful development (I still consider it to be my masterpiece product) and I was ready to move on to something different... I was impressed with the work Jeff Tunnel was doing at Dynamix"[^ref-28]. This move separated the "Two Guys from Andromeda," and Scott Murphy never worked with Crowe on another Space Quest game[^ref-28].

Josh Mandel (later co-designer of Space Quest 6) was initially working on a design for SQ5 at Sierra, but Crowe was asked to take over the project at Dynamix[^ref-28]. Although Crowe had ideas for games using Dynamix's own adventure development system, Sierra CEO Ken Williams mandated that Dynamix use Sierra's SCI engine instead[^ref-28].

Development for Space Quest V began in December 1991 when director Mark Crowe and assistant director David Selle sat down and began roughing out the story line[^ref-3][^ref-4]. It took them about a month of conceptual work to come up with the preliminary design and story[^ref-3].

The next phase was to firm up the story, flesh out the design, and draw storyboards[^ref-3]. Art director Shawn Sharp penciled over 200 sketches for the storyboards over a two-month period[^ref-3][^ref-4]. Background painter Rhonda Conley was responsible for painting the nearly one hundred backgrounds sketched by Sharp[^ref-3].

An extensive list detailing over 1,100 loops of animation was planned, with lead production artist Mike Jahnke and his team put in charge[^ref-4]. After static backgrounds were painted, digitized, and scanned, animation sequences included hand-painted loops and digitized video capture of live actors from a 3-chip video camera[^ref-4].

Space Quest IV and Space Quest VGA composer Ken Allen had his soundtrack rejected for reasons unknown and quit Sierra sometime afterwards[^ref-4]. Dynamix musicians Christopher Stevens and Timothy Steven Clarke were rushed into the project to create a score within a short period of time[^ref-3][^ref-4]. Space Quest V took about fourteen months to finish[^ref-4].

A CD-ROM version with voice acting was planned and hinted in the Hintbook and some magazines, but the project was cancelled. According to SQ5 artist Sean Murphy: "Politics and the fact that Dynamix was going through a very rough financial period at that time prevented us from doing any supplemental work on it... I suspect that the management was eager to move on to another 'big profit' project instead of spending time and resources for a 'gold' version of an already-released game"[^ref-28][^ref-4][^ref-3].

### Technical Achievements
- Developed using Sierra Creative Interpreter 1.1 (SCI1.1)[^ref-3][^ref-4]
- Over 200 storyboard sketches and nearly 100 backgrounds[^ref-3][^ref-4]
- Over 1,100 animation loops including digitized video capture[^ref-4]
- First Space Quest developed by Dynamix rather than Sierra On-Line proper[^ref-18][^ref-2]
- First Space Quest with only one of the "Two Guys from Andromeda" (Mark Crowe)[^ref-18]
- Featured product placement for Sprint telephone company[^ref-18]
- Released February 5, 1993 for MS-DOS on floppy disk only[^ref-18][^ref-2]
- **Aptitude test skip:** Selecting the last option for every question allows Roger to pass the StarCon Aptitude Test without cheating—likely a QA feature left in by mistake[^ref-14]
- **Planet name trivia:** "Lukaszuk II" is not a jab at LucasArts but a tribute to Polish programmer brothers Darius and Piotr Lukaszuk who worked at Dynamix[^ref-14]
- **End-game failsafe:** If players forget to install the warp drive on the Goliath, the game mercifully teleports them to the engine room for a second chance instead of killing them outright[^ref-14]
- Runs at 320x200 resolution with 256 colors; fully supported in ScummVM since version 1.2.0[^ref-21]
- **Floppy installation note:** SCI games have significant variation in resource file naming; for floppy versions with split files, RESOURCE.p0* files must be concatenated to RESOURCE.000 and RESOURCE.a0* to RESOURCE.AUD[^ref-21]

### Easter Eggs and Trivia
- **Star Wars cameo:** Wander around StarCon Academy halls and you'll see Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi dueling in a far-away corridor[^ref-22]
- **Elvis sighting:** Walk to the far east side of the rotunda at StarCon to see Elvis walking through a security checkpoint—Roger can't follow as a lowly cadet[^ref-22]
- **2001: A Space Odyssey homage:** When Roger retrieves Cliffy via EVA pod, the sequence homages Kubrick's film; additionally, *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* plays each time the Eureka collects space trash, with a sun rising behind a planet to reveal a garbage bag floating in space[^ref-22]
- **Pac-Man cameo:** On Level 8 of the vents, Pac-Man chases Roger in a scene modeled after the Gemini Killer's attack in *The Exorcist III*[^ref-22]
- **The Fly reference:** A transporter accident causes Roger to swap heads with a fly[^ref-22]
- **Stealth pun:** The Eureka's self-destruct countdown mechanism is shaped like an egg—an "egg timer"[^ref-22]
- **Self-deprecating humor:** The villainous biotech company Genetix has a logo similar to Dynamix, the game's developer; the manual shows the creative team reading the *Star Trek Compendium* and a *Star Wars* guide with an Alien facehugger model on their desk[^ref-22]
- **Punny planet names:** Gingivitis (in the Halitosis star system), Klorox II (Clorox bleach), Monostadt VII (Monistat 7), Commodore LXIV, Peeyu, and Kiz Urazgubi ("kiss your ass goodbye")[^ref-22]
- **Retraux mode:** In the maintenance tunnel, pulling a fuse reduces colors from 256 to 16—only works in that area since Roger replaces fuses when leaving[^ref-22]
- **EGA anti-frustration:** When running in 16-color EGA mode, the game lets you skip the crest floor-cleaning sequence with full points, since limited colors make determining cleanliness difficult[^ref-22]
- **Aptitude test foreshadowing:** Three puzzle solutions are hidden in the test's multiple choice answers, including how to defeat W-D40 (boulder temporarily, banana in tailpipe permanently) and checking air toxicity before beaming down[^ref-22]
- **Series continuity error:** Roger is pursued for not paying for the Labion terror beast mating whistle from Space Quest II, despite it being marked FREE on the order form[^ref-22]
- **Captain Quirk's full name:** Raemes Tipper Quirk (R.T. Quirk = J.T. Kirk parody)[^ref-22]
- **Astro Chicken cameo:** Open the far left locker in the pod bay to see Astro Chicken pop out[^ref-23]
- **Worf parody:** "Woof" sits in the Academy classroom, described as the Academy's ambu-jitsu champion[^ref-29]
- **Guards playing arcade games:** One guard in the rotunda plays Missile Command; another near Elvis plays Asteroids[^ref-29]
- **SQ3 Skull Fighter:** One of the Skull Fighters from Space Quest 3 appears in the Academy landing bay[^ref-29]
- **Enterprise engine:** A ship in the Academy landing bay has an engine styled after the USS Enterprise[^ref-29]
- **Flash Gordon & Einstein:** Both appear on the gigantic grade master machine—and both fail[^ref-29]
- **Debug hotspot viewer:** Pressing Alt+C blocks out images and shows hotspot colors for click events (doesn't work in Collection version)[^ref-25]
- **Death message viewer (v0.028):** An invisible button below "Space" on the death screen title bar cycles through death messages (causes frequent crashes)[^ref-25]

### Pop Culture References
- **Star Trek "Spock's Brain":** The Teacher device, KARA, and Sigma Draconis reference this episode[^ref-24]
- **Star Trek "Trouble with Tribbles":** Space Monkeys and Nelo Jones parody this episode[^ref-24]
- **Aliens:** "Nuke the entire site from orbit" quote appears[^ref-24]
- **Spaceballs:** "Heinous speed" reference in ending sequence[^ref-24]
- **Hitchhiker's Guide:** Eroticon 6 reference[^ref-24]
- **The Three Stooges:** Moons named Larry, Moe, and Curly[^ref-24]
- **Beverly Hills 90210:** Planet coordinates reference[^ref-24]
- **Nova 9 (Dynamix):** Gir Draxon character from this Dynamix game appears[^ref-24]
- **Mixed Up Mother Goose:** Sierra's game referenced in an elevator death message[^ref-24]
- **Goliath ship:** Parodies the Super Star Destroyer Executor from Star Wars[^ref-24]

### Bugs and Compatibility
- **EVA pod speed bug:** On fast systems, the EVA pod sequence during Cliffy's rescue depletes fuel too rapidly; fixed by NewRisingSun patch or DOSBox[^ref-26]
- **Cloaking device bug:** Cannot restore or quit when Roger runs out of time stealing from WD-40's ship; requires SQ5PAT patch[^ref-26]
- **Crest polish skip bug:** Unable to skip polishing sequence on 286 EGA systems; requires SQ5PAT patch[^ref-26]
- **Icon loss bug:** Icon disappears at river log on Kiz Urazgubi; requires SQ5PAT patch[^ref-26]
- **Audio initialization:** "Unable to Initialize Audio Hardware" error on modern systems; use DOSBox or AUDBLAST.DRV patch[^ref-26]

### International Versions
- **Russian localization:** Flash Gordon references changed to Boris Yeltsin, Soviet movie music replaced some themes, "buckazoid" translated to "babking," and transporter controls differed[^ref-23]
- **32-color Amiga version:** Skipped the crest scrubbing sequence due to color palette limitations[^ref-23]

### Plot Inconsistencies
- **Magazine contradiction:** The Space Piston magazine (SQ4) features an interview with Roger about his adventures, but the Galactic Inquirer (SQ5) states nobody has heard from Roger since he began working on the Arcada[^ref-30]
- **StarCon Crest design:** The main rotunda spans two screens containing the crest, but joining them reveals the crest isn't actually triangular[^ref-30]
- **Cliffy's spacesuit:** When Cliffy spacewalks to repair the Eureka, he wears a spacesuit—but the game established that one suit had a ripped seat and the other was too small for Roger, making it certainly too small for Cliffy[^ref-30]
- **Shield inconsistencies:** The Eureka's shields have no effect on WD-40's attacks, the Goliath, weapons use, or beaming down to some planets, yet shields must be lowered to enter Genetix or Molly's Chug & Glug[^ref-30]
- **Garbage collection paradox:** Players can't visit the SpaceBar until collecting garbage from Gangularis, Peeyu, and Kiz Urazgubi, but WD-40 attacks before collecting trash at the latter—yet the game considers the mission complete[^ref-30]

## Legacy

According to Sierra On-Line's SEC filing, combined sales of the Space Quest series surpassed 1.2 million units by the end of March 1996[^ref-19]. Space Quest V was one of several Sierra games given away as a reward for signing up for service with Sprint[^ref-18][^ref-20].

The game also features a reference to AT&T, with dialogue where one character denounces MCI's "Friends & Aliens" plan as "just not worth it"[^ref-2]. After Space Quest V, Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy would reunite for Space Quest 6: The Spinal Frontier in 1995[^ref-2].
