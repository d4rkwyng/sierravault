## Overview
Space Quest II: Chapter II – Vohaul's Revenge is a graphic adventure game developed and published by [[Sierra On-Line]], released on November 14, 1987 for MS-DOS with subsequent ports to Apple II, Apple IIgs, Amiga, Atari ST, and Macintosh[^ref-3][^ref-6].

Space Quest II was the last game in the series to use Sierra's AGI engine before the transition to SCI for future titles[^ref-3][^ref-4]. The game was a commercial success, selling over 100,000 copies and earning the SPA Gold Medal from the Software Publishers Association[^ref-1][^ref-5].

## Story Summary
Several months after saving his home world of Xenon from the dangers of the Sariens, Roger Wilco accepts a position as Head Janitor aboard Xenon Orbital Station 4 as his fame fades into obscurity[^ref-3]. Contacted by his superiors to clean up a mess on a recently arrived shuttle, Roger finds himself ambushed in the station's hangar bay, where he is knocked out and abducted by unknown assailants[^ref-3].

When Roger regains consciousness, he finds himself a prisoner on an asteroid base orbiting the jungle planet of Labion, run by Sludge Vohaul—a former scientist of Xenon[^ref-3]. Vohaul reveals he was the creator of the Star Generator, but was exiled by Xenon when he sought to have the technology used as a weapon rather than for peace[^ref-6]. Eager for revenge, he attempted to use the Sariens to steal the generator, but was infuriated when Roger thwarted his plan[^ref-3]. Despite the setback, Vohaul is now creating an army of genetically cloned insurance salesmen to help him eradicate life on Xenon[^ref-3][^ref-6].

To punish Roger for his actions, Vohaul sends him to the mines on Labion as a slave[^ref-3]. However, during transport over the jungles, a malfunction on the transport craft causes it to crash, killing Roger's guards[^ref-3]. Escaping detection by Vohaul's goons, Roger makes his way through the jungle to a landing pad and steals a shuttle[^ref-3]. When Vohaul hijacks its controls, Roger is brought back to the asteroid base[^ref-6].

With little choice, Roger sneaks around the base and enters Vohaul's control room, where the scientist decides to keep him imprisoned more permanently—shrinking Roger down and trapping him in a glass jar[^ref-6]. Roger manages to break out and infiltrate a life-support machine that has helped keep Vohaul alive[^ref-6]. Disconnecting it, Roger kills Vohaul, restores himself to normal size, activates a self-destruct sequence, and escapes in a pod as the base is destroyed[^ref-6]. Finding the pod cannot keep him alive forever, Roger enters cryosleep to conserve oxygen while awaiting rescue[^ref-6].

## Gameplay

Space Quest II uses the same AGI engine as the original game, featuring 16-color graphics at 160×200 resolution[^ref-3][^ref-5]. The game supports EGA, CGA, VGA, Hercules Monochrome, MCGA, and Tandy graphics modes[^ref-5].

### Interface and Controls
- The game uses a text parser interface where players type commands such as "LOOK AROUND" and "GET KEYCARD"[^ref-5]
- Optional joystick support is available[^ref-5]
- Sound is played through the PC's internal speaker; Apple and Amiga users had improved sound with 3 simultaneous tones instead of 1[^ref-5]
- The game requires 256K of RAM[^ref-5]

### Structure and Progression
- The game takes place across multiple locations: Xenon Orbital Station 4, the jungle planet Labion, and Vohaul's Asteroid Fortress[^ref-3][^ref-6]
- Roger must survive the dangers of the Labion jungle, including various hostile creatures and environments[^ref-3]
- The game continues the series tradition of numerous death scenes with sardonic humor[^ref-6]

### Puzzles and Mechanics
- Like its predecessor, the game features inventory-based puzzles requiring careful item collection and usage[^ref-6]
- PC Magazine praised the challenge level but warned players "don't kid yourself by thinking you'll get by without the Hint Book"[^ref-28]
- Computer Gaming World noted some objects' unclear descriptions were particularly problematic with CGA graphics[^ref-30]
- The hidden location of a gem was criticized as "ridiculously illogical" since the entrance to the underwater cave is not shown on screen[^ref-30]
- The game contains two mazes: a single-screen maze with passages only 2-3 pixels wide (touching the sides kills Roger instantly, reminiscent of the board game "Operation"), and a multi-screen maze in near-total darkness requiring mapping to navigate[^ref-19]
- Typical of Sierra games, numerous dead ends exist where missing an item or making wrong choices renders the game unwinnable—including an alien kiss that poisons Roger, killing him much later if not addressed[^ref-19]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews
Space Quest II was a commercial success from launch, receiving significant praise from critics for improved puzzles and greater scope compared to the original[^ref-28]. PC Magazine wrote: "Lovers of challenge, come hither! Sierra On-Line has the game for you," praising the "terrific" EGA graphics while noting many details were not visible with CGA graphics[^ref-28].

Computer Gaming World stated: "Though the game is similar to the original Space Quest, the addition of more detailed animation, more difficult puzzles, an improved parser (hurrah!), and greater scope makes a good game even better"[^ref-30]. Antic warned of the difficulty, stating that the ST version "is trickier than the original and graphically superior"[^ref-29]. Macworld wrote that "as in the original game, Space Quest II succeeds with the humor of its animation and scripting"[^ref-31].

Space Quest II was listed number four in Sierra's Top 5 Bestsellers, indicating sales over 100,000 copies and earning the SPA Gold Medal from the Software Publishers Association[^ref-1][^ref-5].

### Modern Assessment
Adventure Gamers noted that while the text parser may frustrate modern gamers, "it can also yield very rewarding puzzles" and praised the game's humor, including a memorable multi-species public restroom "designed to accommodate all possibilities"[^ref-19]. The game holds a MobyScore of 7.2/10 with 70% positive critic reviews and ratings from 111 players[^ref-6]. On GOG, the Space Quest 1+2+3 collection has a 4.3/5 rating from 577 users[^ref-7]. HowLongToBeat reports the main story takes approximately 2.8 hours to complete[^ref-8].

- **MobyGames:** 7.2/10 MobyScore, 70% critics (111 player ratings)[^ref-6]
- **GOG:** 4.3/5 (577 ratings, collection)[^ref-7]
- **Steam:** Very Positive (312 reviews, collection)[^ref-9]
- **GameFAQs:** 3.68/5 (77 ratings), rated "Tough" difficulty[^ref-22]
- **HowLongToBeat:** 2.8 hours main story[^ref-8]

## Development

### Origins
Space Quest II was developed by the same team that created the original—Mark Crowe handling art and Scott Murphy programming[^ref-2][^ref-6][^ref-14]. The game was released approximately one year after the original, continuing the story of Roger Wilco and the villainous Sludge Vohaul[^ref-3][^ref-15].

Designer Scott Murphy later clarified the relationship between the Vohauls: Sludge Vohaul and Slash Vohaul (mentioned in SQ1's data cartridge) were intended to be brothers—while evil Sludge invented the Star Generator as a weapon of destruction, good-natured Slash planned to use it for the benefit of the universe, leading to their conflict[^ref-19].

The original game came with: a box, two 3.5" game disks or three 5.25" disks (versions 2.0A through 2.0F), The Space Piston Magazine booklet with the game manual inserted in the middle, a reference card, an optional hint book for $7.95 (available in both adventure gaming window edition and hint pen revealer edition), registration card, and Sierra games catalogue[^ref-5]. The game was originally sold for $49.99[^ref-5].

### Technical Achievements
- Used Sierra's AGI (Adventure Game Interpreter) engine with 160×200 resolution and 16 colors[^ref-3][^ref-5]
- Supported multiple graphics modes: EGA, CGA, VGA, Hercules Monochrome, MCGA, and Tandy[^ref-5]
- Improved parser over the original game[^ref-30]
- More detailed animation compared to Space Quest I[^ref-30]
- Last Space Quest game to use the AGI engine[^ref-3][^ref-4]
- Platform releases: November 14, 1987 MS-DOS, 1987 Atari ST and Apple II, 1988 Amiga, Apple IIgs, and Macintosh[^ref-6]
- **Enhanced audio:** Running in DOSBox with `machine=tandy` enables 3-voice PCjr/Tandy music; alternatively, the AGI-MIDI patch allows all three voices through modern sound cards[^ref-23]

### Debug Modes and Cut Content
- **Debug mode:** Typing DBG or BACKSTAGE enables debug commands including teleport (TP), position setting (POS), and inventory manipulation (GET OBJECT); TESTER displays Roger's coordinates; CLOCK shows game time[^ref-21]
- **Unused content:** Data mining revealed unused graphics including walking animations for blonde technicians and Roger's boss, a pink slug creature, an Atari 2600-style bird, and ruins of two spaceships intended for Labion[^ref-21]
- **Cut content:** A death message reading "Too bad you've failed miserably and doomed all your people to a horrible death" was removed; a Stevie Wonder joke was replaced; toilet paper humor was cut "for matters of taste"[^ref-21]
- **Source code leak:** Versions 2.0D and 2.0F accidentally shipped with ~70% of Sierra's AGI interpreter source code left on disk 1 due to improper formatting of the master disk—the same mistake occurred with King's Quest III v2.14[^ref-21]

### Easter Eggs and Trivia
- **Easter eggs:** When caught in a hunter's snare, Roger dreams he's Larry Laffer from Leisure Suit Larry; a hidden pit trap responds to "look at trap" with the narrator sarcastically replying "What trap? I don't see any trap!"[^ref-20]; typing "cheat" displays an alternative ending screen with 255/250 points[^ref-26]; Scott Murphy secretly added a message mocking Mark Crowe that appears when players attempt an inappropriate action with a corpse[^ref-26]
- **Parser humor:** One puzzle requires literally typing "the word" when told to "say the word"[^ref-20]
- **Notable deaths:** A floor waxer squishes Roger into a pancake; lighting a lighter in the bathroom causes a methane explosion that destroys part of the asteroid[^ref-20]
- **Sci-fi parodies:** Vohaul's ape-like guards resemble Planet of the Apes; an alien's kiss leads to a chestburster-style death parodying Alien; the escape pod ending mirrors Alien's finale with Roger entering cryosleep hoping for rescue[^ref-20]
- **Printing error:** The game's original packaging advertised a "FREE Mating Whistle" mail-in offer, but Sierra never actually created the whistles—Mark Crowe took the blame for this oversight[^ref-16]
- **Pop culture note:** Sludge Vohaul provides the page image for TVTropes' "Dark Lord on Life Support" entry[^ref-20]

## Legacy

According to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of the Space Quest series surpassed 1.2 million units by the end of March 1996[^ref-32]. Space Quest II established Sludge Vohaul as the series' recurring arch-nemesis, a role he would continue to play throughout the franchise[^ref-3].

In 2011, [[Infamous Adventures]] released a fan remake of Space Quest II on December 31, featuring VGA-style graphics, a full voice cast, and extended content[^ref-27]. The project was announced on April 1, 2007 and took over five years to complete[^ref-27]. Version 2.0 was released on January 1, 2020 with bug fixes, graphical refinements, and new hidden content including a Space Quest III easter egg[^ref-27]. The remake is available for Windows, macOS (including Apple Silicon), and Linux as a free download[^ref-27]. The game was followed by Space Quest III: The Pirates of Pestulon in 1989, which transitioned the series to the SCI engine[^ref-4].

## See Also

Space Quest II - Vohaul's Revenge builds upon the narrative foundation established in Space Quest - The Sarien Encounter, as Roger Wilco once again finds himself entangled in a battle against the villainous Sludge Vohaul. This sequel delves deeper into the backstory of Vohaul, revealing his motivations for revenge against Xenon and his role in creating the Star Generator, which was central to the plot of the first game. The gameplay mechanics also see refinement, with the continued use of the AGI engine and text parser interface, although the puzzles and challenges introduced in Space Quest II are more complex and require careful navigation and item management.

The transition from Space Quest - The Sarien Encounter to Space Quest II - Vohaul's Revenge is marked by an increase in the stakes for Roger Wilco, as he faces off against a more personal enemy in Sludge Vohaul. The story expands the Space Quest universe, introducing new locations such as the jungle planet of Labion and Vohaul's Asteroid Fortress, which add to the richness and diversity of the series' setting. Mechanically, the game retains the core elements that defined the first entry, including inventory-based puzzles and a variety of death scenes, but with an increased emphasis on exploration and survival in hostile environments.

Looking ahead to Space Quest III - The Pirates of Pestulon, it is clear that the events of Space Quest II - Vohaul's Revenge set the stage for Roger Wilco's future adventures. Although specific narrative connections between the two games are not immediately apparent from the context of Space Quest II alone, the evolution of gameplay mechanics and the expansion of the series' universe in Space Quest II undoubtedly pave the way for the new challenges and storylines introduced in Space Quest III. The transition to the SCI engine in future titles also promises significant advancements in graphics and gameplay capabilities, potentially altering the way players interact with the world of Space Quest.
