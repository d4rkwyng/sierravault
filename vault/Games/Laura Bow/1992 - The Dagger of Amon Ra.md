# The Dagger of Amon Ra

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 12, 2026</small>

## Overview

*The Dagger of Amon Ra* is a murder mystery adventure game developed and published by [[Sierra On-Line]] in 1992, serving as the second and final installment in the Laura Bow Mysteries series[^ref-1]. Set in 1926 New York City during the height of the Egyptology craze following the discovery of King Tutankhamun's tomb, the game follows cub reporter Laura Bow as she investigates a series of murders at the prestigious Leyendecker Museum[^ref-8]. The game is often regarded by Sierra fans as "among the last decent adventure titles produced by the company before its eventual demise as a developer of adventure games"[^ref-3].

Unlike its predecessor *The Colonel's Bequest*, this sequel was not written or designed by [[Roberta Williams]], though she served as creative consultant to ensure consistency between the two games[^ref-1]. Designer [[Bruce Balfour]] took the lead on writing and puzzle design, bringing his experience from working on *Neuromancer* and *Wasteland* to the project[^ref-4]. The game represents a significant breakthrough in featuring "a strong female lead in a computer game... a female character who is both charming and intelligent"[^ref-3], distinguishing Laura Bow from the more sexualized heroines that would later dominate gaming.

The game showcases gorgeous hand-painted, Art Deco-style backgrounds inspired by illustrator J.C. Leyendecker, complemented by an evocative roaring twenties orchestrated soundtrack[^ref-5]. Available initially on floppy disk and later on CD-ROM with full voice acting, *The Dagger of Amon Ra* remains playable today through ScummVM and is available on GOG.com[^ref-6].

## Story Summary

One year after the events of *The Colonel's Bequest*, Laura Bow has graduated from Tulane University and, with help from her father (a detective from New Orleans), landed a job at the New York Daily Register Newspaper Tribune[^ref-9]. Her first major assignment is to cover the newest exhibit acquired by the local Leyendecker Museum: an ancient Egyptian dagger known as the Dagger of Amon Ra[^ref-8]. The story begins with an ocean crossing, establishing the international intrigue surrounding the artifact[^ref-10].

During a gala party to celebrate the opening of the museum's new Egyptian wing, chaos ensues when someone is murdered and the priceless dagger is stolen[^ref-8]. Laura, demonstrating the investigative spirit that served her well in Louisiana, asks to be allowed to investigate and finds herself locked in the museum with the rest of the guests—socialites, miscreants, thieves, and a cold, relentless murderer[^ref-6]. As the night progresses, more bodies appear in increasingly gruesome conditions, and Laura must gather clues and interrogate suspects to unravel the mystery[^ref-11].

The cast of characters includes Dr. Pippin Carter, an archaeologist who compares himself to his cousin (implied to be Howard Carter, discoverer of Tutankhamun's tomb)[^ref-1]; Detective Ryan O'Riley[^ref-12]; and numerous other suspects with their own secrets and motives.

> Detective O'Riley proves to be more involved in the crimes than his badge suggests[^ref-12]. Laura's romantic interest Steve Dorian, a stevedore at the museum, becomes increasingly important as the plot unfolds—a reference in *Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers* suggests that Laura eventually marries him and becomes Laura Dorian[^ref-4].

The game features four distinct endings depending on the thoroughness of the player's investigation[^ref-13]. Only through meticulous detective work—examining every clue and questioning every character repeatedly—can players achieve the best possible ending[^ref-14].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

*The Dagger of Amon Ra* utilizes Sierra's icon-based graphic interface, a significant departure from the text parser system used in *The Colonel's Bequest*[^ref-5]. This makes it more accessible than its predecessor and similar to other contemporary Sierra adventures[^ref-15]. The game adds an innovative "Ask" icon functionality that allows Laura to question characters about various topics, with a notebook system that automatically records important information[^ref-14].

Players interact with the environment using standard Sierra icons including Walk, Look, Hand, Talk, and a magnifying glass for close examination[^ref-16]. The interface encourages thorough exploration, as many clues can only be discovered by examining objects carefully with the magnifying glass.

### Structure and Progression

The game is divided into six distinct acts, with time passing automatically during exploration as suspects move on individual schedules[^ref-17]:

- **Act I: A Nose for News** - Laura explores 1926 New York City, visiting locations including the newspaper office, police station, Lo Fat's Chinese Laundry, and the Harlem Swinger Speakeasy[^ref-18]
- **Act II: Suspects on Parade** - The gala party at the Leyendecker Museum where Laura meets all the major characters[^ref-18]
- **Act III: On the Cutting Edge** - The first murder occurs and the dagger is stolen; Laura begins her investigation in earnest[^ref-18]
- **Act IV: Museum of the Dead** - More bodies appear as Laura explores the museum's secret passages and hidden rooms[^ref-18]
- **Act V: Rex Takes a Bite Out of Crime** - The investigation reaches its climax with dangerous encounters in the dinosaur exhibit[^ref-18]
- **Act VI: The Coroner's Inquest** - A courtroom-style finale where Laura must identify the killers and motives; notably, players cannot save during this act[^ref-19]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The gameplay focuses primarily on exploration and clue-gathering rather than traditional puzzle-solving, though there are more instances of inventory item collection and usage compared to the first game[^ref-8]. Players must take careful note of each character's personality and life history based on discoveries throughout the game[^ref-20].

The game includes potentially frustrating "dead man walking" scenarios where essential items must be collected before leaving certain areas. If players miss cheese or snake-oil in early acts, they cannot complete the game[^ref-12]. The floppy version has an additional issue where failing to find Steve's boot in the medieval exhibit locks players out of completion[^ref-12].

The original floppy version features copy protection requiring players to answer trivia questions about Egyptian gods and goddesses, with answers found in the game manual[^ref-17]. This protection appears in Acts 1, 3, and 5[^ref-20]. The CD-ROM version removed this requirement entirely[^ref-21].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

*Computer Gaming World* praised the game as "much improved over *The Colonel's Bequest*" and described it as "a visual and aural treat" and "another quality adventure from the fertile minds at Sierra"[^ref-5]. Chuck Miller's review highlighted "the gorgeous hand-painted, Art Deco-style backgrounds to the evocative roaring 20s orchestrated soundtrack, a certain richness permeates the atmosphere of the game"[^ref-5]. He concluded that "armchair detectives and amateur sleuths alike will find *The Dagger of Amon Ra* an enjoyable adventure and a nostalgic excursion into 1920s America"[^ref-5].

*PC Games* called it "a captivating whodunit" with "near-perfect blending of sound effects, music, and graphics"[^ref-1]. *Dragon* magazine awarded it 4 out of 5 stars[^ref-1]. The game retailed for $69.95 at launch[^ref-5].

However, *Computer Gaming World* later ranked the game's finale as #7 on their list of "Least Rewarding Endings of All Time" in November 1996[^ref-8], reflecting criticism of the challenging final act.

### Modern Assessment

Modern reviewers have offered mixed perspectives on the game. Adventure Classic Gaming awarded it 3 out of 5 stars (Good), with reviewer Robert Perrett praising the strong female protagonist while acknowledging the game's technical limitations[^ref-3]. The Adventurers' Guild blog gave a more critical assessment of 52/100, scoring Puzzles at 2/10, Interface at 3/10, Story at 5/10, Graphics/Sound at 8/10, Environment at 6/10, and Dialogue at 7/10[^ref-12].

Hardcore Gaming 101 noted that "despite Roberta Williams' name on the box, she had little to do with *The Dagger of Amon Ra* beyond providing the concept and lending her character to star in a new game"[^ref-4]. The site also observed that "it's practically impossible to get the good ending the first time through"[^ref-4].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **GOG.com:** 4.4/5 (34 reviews)[^ref-6]
- **IMDb:** 7.8/10 (67 ratings)[^ref-22]
- **MobyGames Critics:** 75%[^ref-8]
- **OldGames.sk:** 78%[^ref-23]
- **MyAbandonware:** 4.54/5 (70 votes)[^ref-24]

## Development

### Origins

The project originated from a proposal by writer [[Josh Mandel]], who recognized that Laura Bow needed to progress beyond the bayou setting of the first game[^ref-25]. "I knew that we could not have Laura still in the house on the bayou," Mandel explained. "She had to have progressed and become slightly older, so I suggested that, fresh out of journalism school, she become a cub reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper"[^ref-25].

The Egyptian setting emerged organically from the team's brainstorming. "Something about ancient Egyptian lore seemed like a reasonably exotic and mysterious topic for the central mystery, around which all the murders would occur," Mandel recalled[^ref-25]. This choice capitalized on the ongoing public fascination with Egyptology sparked by Howard Carter's 1922 discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb.

[[Roberta Williams]] took an "executive designer" role, simultaneously overseeing this project and *King's Quest VI*, turning over the day-to-day details to assistant designers[^ref-26]. She explained her approach: "I took on a co-designer for a couple of reasons: I wanted to train Jane because I didn't want Sierra to be dependent on me. Someone else needs to know how to do a 'proper' adventure game"[^ref-26].

### Production

[[Bruce Balfour]] served as lead designer, handling writing and puzzle designs while Williams ensured "the feel of *The Colonel's Bequest* and *The Dagger of Amon Ra* remained consistent"[^ref-8]. Balfour reportedly worked on the game while watching Gulf War coverage on television in a hotel room[^ref-17]. He brought his background from *Neuromancer* and *Wasteland* to the project[^ref-4].

Mandel recommended Balfour to Williams for the design role, and the two collaborated closely on the game's development[^ref-25]. Balfour pored over various art styles before finding inspiration in J.C. Leyendecker's work[^ref-25]. Due to budget constraints, no first-hand research was conducted for historical accuracy—"Writer Josh Mandel admitted they didn't exactly have the budget to conduct extensive research for historical accuracy"[^ref-27].

The elaborate death scenes, which featured victims meeting gruesome ends connected to museum exhibits (including being devoured by Dermestid beetles), were "Bruce's (slightly perverse) imagination at work," according to Mandel[^ref-25]. The game's mature content led some fans to observe that "some of the verbal content was raunchier than the Leisure Suit Larry games"[^ref-28].

### Technical Achievements

The game runs on Sierra's SCI 1.1 engine, representing a significant technical advancement over the SCI0 engine used in *The Colonel's Bequest*[^ref-3]. It features 320x200 resolution with 256-color VGA graphics[^ref-3], creating the gorgeous Art Deco visuals that drew comparisons to J.C. Leyendecker's illustrations.

The visual style was deliberately modeled on Leyendecker's artwork, with the museum itself named after the artist[^ref-1]. The game cover was directly inspired by Leyendecker's 18 March 1905 Saturday Evening Post cover[^ref-1]. The museum exterior was based on the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.[^ref-1]

Lisa Crabtree, Sierra's receptionist, posed as Laura Bow for the box cover[^ref-3]. "By the way, on the box cover, we asked our receptionist Lisa Crabtree to pose as Laura Bow," Williams noted. "It was kind of cute how visitors would sometimes ask where they've seen her before"[^ref-3].

### Version History

| Version | Date | Platform | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| 1.0 | 1992 | DOS (floppy) | Initial release with copy protection[^ref-8] |
| 1.1 | 1992 | DOS | UK version[^ref-8] |
| CD-ROM | 1993 | DOS/Windows | Voice acting added, copy protection removed, some bugs fixed[^ref-21] |
| GOG | Feb 16, 2017 | Windows | ScummVM-based re-release[^ref-7] |

**SCI Interpreter Versions:**[^ref-7]
- **Engine:** SCI 1.1
- **Video Modes:** MCGA, EGA, VGA

The CD-ROM version made several modifications beyond adding voice acting: taxi rides were shortened, copy protection was removed, and some bugs were fixed[^ref-21]. The CD-ROM version also modified character portraits for Laura, Ziggy, and Steve Dorian, and improved lip-sync animation[^ref-27].

### Technical Issues

The game has numerous documented bugs and compatibility issues:

- **Endless Driving Bug:** Taxi drives endlessly without reaching destination[^ref-30]
- **Moving Painting Bug:** Painting in Carrington's office can only be opened once[^ref-30]
- **Error 5:** Occurs in Act 5 when Laura opens transom and goes into mummy room—"You did something that we weren't expecting. You don't need to do it to finish the game"[^ref-30]
- **Audio Initialization Failure:** "Unable to initialize your audio hardware" error requires updated AUDBLAST.DRV driver[^ref-31]
- **Sound Loop Bug:** With updated drivers, digital sound may loop indefinitely[^ref-31]
- **Control Panel Issues:** Sometimes disabled, preventing saves[^ref-32]
- **Save/Restore Bugs:** Game occasionally refuses to restore from saved games[^ref-32]
- **Out of Handles Error:** Occurs in DosBox version[^ref-12]

The game uses AUDBLAST.DRV audio driver rather than DACBLAST.DRV used by other Sierra games, and requires audioSize setting of 32k in RESOURCE.CFG to avoid audio glitches[^ref-33].

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

The game contains numerous Sierra in-jokes and cultural references:

- **King's Quest References:** A unicorn in storage vats bears a note reading "Possibly left over from a King's Quest game"; King Edward of Daventry appears preserved in alcohol in the preservation lab[^ref-8]
- **EcoQuest Reference:** The star "Deneb Kaitos Ecoquestus" references Sierra's ecological adventure series[^ref-8]
- **Anonymous Bosch Painting:** Shows skeletons torturing "a dead king named Graham"[^ref-8]
- **Buy Sierra Products:** Hieroglyphics in a passage translate to "buy Sierra products"[^ref-9]
- **The Prisoner Reference:** When inspecting an NPC at the speakeasy, Laura's observation quotes "Questions are a burden to others; answers are a burden to oneself," paraphrasing the 1967-68 TV series[^ref-34]
- **Ronald Reagan Joke:** The 3.5" floppy disk version contains a sign for "The Ronald Reagan Home For the Mentally Bewildered" on a building across from the newspaper office—this was removed from subsequent versions[^ref-28]
- **Oakhurst Reference:** Using the magnifying glass on the glass reveals a reference to Sierra's hometown of Oakhurst, California[^ref-9]
- **Clara Bow Tribute:** Laura Bow's name is a pun on silent film star Clara Bow[^ref-1]

Clicking on the empty pyramid case where the dagger should be displays: "Congratulations! You've cracked the case of the Dagger of Amon Ra"[^ref-17].

### Multiple Endings

The game features four distinct endings based on the player's investigation thoroughness[^ref-13]. The final act (Act VI: The Coroner's Inquest) presents Laura with questions about the murders, victims, and motives. "Only thorough detective work will result in the best possible ending for Laura Bow, Cub Reporter. (You'll know it when you see it!)"[^ref-14]

Key variables affecting endings include:
- Whether all clues were collected
- Whether all characters were thoroughly questioned
- Whether secret passages were discovered
- Accuracy of answers during the Coroner's Inquest

As Hardcore Gaming 101 noted, "it's practically impossible to get the good ending the first time through"[^ref-4].

Voice acting was performed by Sierra staff rather than professional actors[^ref-35]. Josh Mandel's voice for Steve Dorian was electronically lowered[^ref-17]. GOG.com user reviews noted that "Voice acting is atrocious but in an endearing way"[^ref-6]. Leslie Balfour, who voiced Laura and several other characters, later reflected: "The Dagger of Amon Ra is a great game, but for me, the prize was my husband of 23 years"—she married designer Bruce Balfour[^ref-17].

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

The game achieved strong initial distribution through Sierra's retail channels and debuted in the top two positions on the company's internal sales charts in Fall 1992[^ref-13]. The $69.95 price point was standard for Sierra adventures of the era[^ref-5].

### Collections

The game appeared in several Sierra compilations:
- **1997 King's Quest Collection** - Included alongside *The Colonel's Bequest*[^ref-9]
- **Roberta Williams Anthology** - Collected Williams' adventure games[^ref-9]
- **CD-ROM 2 Pak: Crime City / The Dagger of Amon Ra** (1993)[^ref-8]

### Fan Projects

A fan sequel titled *Manhattan Murders* was planned but ultimately abandoned[^ref-12]. In 2019, NineZyme Entertainment announced a third Laura Bow game, demonstrating continued interest in the series[^ref-27].

### Related Publications

- **Leyendecker Museum Guide:** Included with game, featuring museum layout maps[^ref-19]
- **Game Manual:** Contains copy protection answers (Egyptian gods information)[^ref-14]
- **Museum Card Map:** One of two maps included with the game[^ref-19]

### Critical Perspective

*The Dagger of Amon Ra* occupies an interesting position in adventure gaming history. While not as commercially successful or well-remembered as Sierra's flagship King's Quest series, the Laura Bow games were "genuinely groundbreaking"[^ref-25] in their approach to mature mystery storytelling with a strong female protagonist.

The game represents one of Sierra's last traditional adventure games before the company shifted focus in the mid-1990s[^ref-3]. Its Art Deco visual style, orchestral soundtrack, and attention to period detail demonstrate the production values Sierra brought to even its secondary franchises.

The contrast between Laura Bow and later heroines like Lara Croft is notable. As Adventure Classic Gaming observed, "Perhaps Laura does not have breasts hanging out like Tomb Raider's Lara Croft; then again, Laura is not meant to be a sex object like Lara"[^ref-3]. This design philosophy reflected Sierra's approach to female protagonists—intelligent, capable characters defined by their wit rather than their appearance.

The game's challenging difficulty and possibility of unwinnable states reflect adventure gaming conventions of the era that modern players often find frustrating. As one reviewer noted, "the main purpose of a mystery story is to be logical" yet "the plot has more holes than a minefield"[^ref-12]. Despite these criticisms, the game remains beloved by those who appreciate its atmosphere, humor, and period charm.

## See Also

The Dagger of Amon Ra builds upon the foundations established in The Colonel's Bequest, with Laura Bow now a cub reporter in 1926 New York City, investigating a series of murders at the Leyendecker Museum. This sequel introduces new gameplay mechanics, such as the icon-based graphic interface and the "Ask" icon functionality, which allows for more interactive conversations with characters. The game's story also explores new themes, including the Egyptology craze following the discovery of King Tutankhamun's tomb, and features a new cast of characters, including Dr. Pippin Carter and Detective Ryan O'Riley.

The Dagger of Amon Ra's narrative is distinct from its predecessor, with a greater emphasis on international intrigue and high-society settings, but it retains the same spirit of investigative mystery and adventure that defined The Colonel's Bequest. Laura Bow's character development continues, showcasing her intelligence, charm, and determination as she navigates the complex web of suspects and motives. The game's multiple endings, which depend on the player's thoroughness in investigating the crimes, add a layer of replayability and depth to the story.

As the final installment in the Laura Bow Mysteries series, The Dagger of Amon Ra concludes Laura's adventures on a high note, with its engaging storyline, memorable characters, and innovative gameplay mechanics. Although there is no direct sequel, the game's influence can be seen in later adventure games, and its legacy continues to be celebrated by fans of the genre. The character of Laura Bow also makes appearances in other Sierra games, such as Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, where her future life and marriage to Steve Dorian are referenced, providing a sense of continuity and closure for the series.
