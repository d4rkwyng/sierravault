## Development

After Triskell Interactive pitched a city-building game to Dotemu, the publisher asked if they would be interested in remaking a game from the City Building series.[^ref-4] Triskell chose Pharaoh, and Dotemu licensed the intellectual property from Activision, which had acquired Sierra Entertainment and its subsidiaries including Impressions Games.[^ref-4]

The development team focused on preserving the core gameplay while modernizing the presentation. Key changes from the original include:

- **Updated Graphics:** Completely redrawn artwork with the ability to zoom in on buildings and citizens[^ref-1]
- **Quality of Life Improvements:** Optional global worker pool system similar to [[2000 - Zeus - Master of Olympus|Zeus: Master of Olympus]], bypassing the need for individual recruiters[^ref-1]
- **Nile Flood Tracking:** Enhanced visualization of the river's flood cycles[^ref-1]

## Gameplay

The gameplay remains faithful to the original Pharaoh while incorporating modern quality-of-life improvements.[^ref-1] Players take on the role of a city planner in ancient Egypt, tasked with building thriving settlements along the Nile across more than 50 missions and over 100 hours of gameplay.[^ref-3]

### Core Mechanics

- **City Planning:** Placing residential, commercial, and industrial buildings to create functional neighborhoods[^ref-3]
- **Monument Construction:** Building iconic Egyptian structures including pyramids, the Sphinx, and the Lighthouse of Alexandria[^ref-3]
- **Resource Management:** Balancing food production, trade goods, and construction materials across internal and external trade networks[^ref-3]
- **Nile Management:** Working with the river's annual flood cycles for agriculture, tracked via an improved Nilometer indicator[^ref-3]
- **Military Defense:** Protecting cities from invaders and enemies[^ref-3]
- **Religion & Culture:** Building temples and mausoleums to manage city health, culture, and the polytheistic religion of the era[^ref-3]

### Interface and Controls

The remake features a completely redesigned user interface with numerous improvements over the original:[^ref-3]

- **Zoom Functionality:** Players can zoom in to view detailed hand-drawn artwork up close[^ref-1]
- **Workers Tooltip:** New indicator showing worker allocation and availability[^ref-3]
- **Fixed Worker Ratio:** Option to set consistent staffing levels across buildings[^ref-3]
- **Global Labor Pool:** Optional system (borrowed from [[2000 - Zeus - Master of Olympus|Zeus]]) that recruits workers from a global pool rather than requiring house-to-house recruiters[^ref-1]
- **Building Copy-Paste:** Ability to quickly duplicate building placements[^ref-3]
- **Predator Toggle:** Option to disable dangerous animals for a more relaxed experience[^ref-3]
- **Population Mood Tracking:** New tools for monitoring citizen happiness[^ref-3]

### Game Modes

- **Campaign Mode:** 50+ missions teaching game basics while telling a story set in ancient Egypt[^ref-3]
- **Sandbox Mode:** Free-build mode for creating the metropolis of your dreams[^ref-3]

## Series Continuity

Pharaoh: A New Era is a remake of the original Pharaoh, which was the second entry in Impressions Games' City Building series after [[1998 - Caesar III|Caesar III]].

**City Building Series (Impressions/Sierra):**
- [[1998 - Caesar III|Caesar III]] (1998)
- [[1999 - Pharaoh|Pharaoh]] (1999) → **Pharaoh: A New Era** (2023 remake)
- [[2000 - Zeus - Master of Olympus|Zeus: Master of Olympus]] (2000)
- [[2002 - Emperor - Rise of the Middle Kingdom|Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom]] (2002)

## Legacy

Pharaoh: A New Era represents a successful revival of the classic Impressions Games city-builder formula for modern audiences.[^ref-1] The game celebrates the 20th anniversary of the original franchise with its release, demonstrating continued interest in the City Building series.[^ref-3]

The remake includes the content from both the original Pharaoh and its expansion [[2000 - Cleopatra - Queen of the Nile|Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile]] in a single package.[^ref-3] This makes it the definitive way to experience the Egyptian city-builder today, with the original games no longer readily available on modern digital storefronts.[^ref-10]

The success of Pharaoh: A New Era has sparked community interest in potential remakes of other City Building series entries, particularly [[2000 - Zeus - Master of Olympus|Zeus: Master of Olympus]] and [[2002 - Emperor - Rise of the Middle Kingdom|Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom]].[^ref-13]
