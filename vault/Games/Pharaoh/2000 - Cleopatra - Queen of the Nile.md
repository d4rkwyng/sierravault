# Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 30, 2026</small>

## Overview

**Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile** is an expansion pack for the city-building strategy game Pharaoh, developed by BreakAway Games and published by Sierra Entertainment in 2000[^ref-1]. The expansion brings players into the latter years of the Egyptian Empire, focusing on the era of Cleopatra VII with all the monuments and architecture associated with her legendary reign[^ref-2]. As the tagline proclaimed: "Build a Kingdom. Rule the Nile. Live Forever."[^ref-3]

The game continues the Pharaoh story with missions entirely set within the New Kingdom[^ref-4], covering the historical period from 1490 BC to 35 BC[^ref-1]. Players immerse themselves in ancient Egypt and nurture fledgling villages into thriving metropolises, governing all aspects of the exotic Egyptian culture—from religion to trading with distant cities[^ref-5]. The expansion builds on Pharaoh's foundation, which was itself praised for taking "Impressions' popular Caesar III, relocates it to ancient Egypt, and adds a few welcome features"[^ref-24].

GameSpot called it "a rare thing to find an expansion worthy of the original"[^ref-15], while the game earned a Metacritic aggregate score of 77/100[^ref-18] and a GameRankings score of 82%[^ref-7]. The expansion requires the base game Pharaoh to be present on the system and cannot be played independently[^ref-6].

## Story Summary

### Historical Context

The expansion follows the reign of Cleopatra VII, the last Pharaoh of Egypt, whose intelligence, political acumen, and legendary allure left an indelible mark on history[^ref-8]. Born circa 70 BC, Cleopatra ruled Egypt for approximately 20 years until her death in 30 BC[^ref-10]. Through personal and political alliances—first with Julius Caesar and then with Mark Antony—she maintained the independent power of Egypt as long as she was able[^ref-11].

The narrative spans Cleopatra's life from her rise to the throne to her tragic death[^ref-9], encompassing the twilight of ancient Egyptian civilization as an independent power. As one character proclaims in the game's narrative: "I am more than a woman! I am a goddess. The Egyptians say that I am the goddess Isis."[^ref-12]

### Campaign Themes

The expansion's missions cover different historical periods including:

- **Tomb Building**: Construction of elaborate burial monuments
- **Ramesses II's Exploits**: Commemorating the legendary pharaoh's achievements
- **The Fall of Egypt**: The 1st century BC collapse of Egyptian independence[^ref-1]

The missions provide context for the grand construction projects and political maneuvering that defined ancient Egypt's final centuries as an independent civilization.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The game uses a two-dimensional isometric perspective[^ref-1] with 16-bit color graphics[^ref-7]. Players interact with the game using keyboard controls[^ref-1], managing various aspects of Egyptian city life including the crucial Nile River's annual flooding cycles[^ref-13]. The interface builds upon the established Caesar III engine, adapted for the Ancient Egyptian setting[^ref-14].

The view provides a clear overview of city layout while allowing players to zoom in on specific areas for detailed management. Menus provide access to building options, economy reports, religion status, and military commands.

### Structure and Progression

Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile offers both campaign and free-build game modes[^ref-1]. The expansion adds 15 new campaign missions[^ref-6] that focus specifically on Cleopatra's era, each with unique victory conditions and challenges.

Campaign missions typically require players to:

- Achieve specific population targets
- Build designated monuments
- Maintain favorable ratings in culture, prosperity, monument, and kingdom metrics
- Complete objectives within time limits (in some scenarios)

The free-build mode allows players to construct Egyptian cities without mission constraints, providing a sandbox experience for those who prefer creative building over objective-based gameplay.

### Economic Systems

The core gameplay revolves around city-building and management mechanics. Players must manage complex economics using **deben** as currency[^ref-7]. The economic system includes:

- **Agriculture**: Farming along the Nile floodplain
- **Industry**: Producing goods from raw materials
- **Trade**: Exchanging resources with other cities
- **Taxation**: Collecting revenue from citizens

The annual Nile flood cycle is central to the economic system. Players must plan their agricultural zones to take advantage of the fertile soil deposited by flooding while protecting infrastructure from water damage.

### Religion System

Players must appease five Egyptian gods[^ref-7] through proper city planning and monument construction:

- **Ra** - Sun god, patron of pharaohs
- **Osiris** - God of the afterlife and agriculture
- **Ptah** - God of craftsmen and architects
- **Seth** - God of chaos and storms
- **Bast** - Goddess of home and cats

Each god requires temples and festivals. Neglecting any deity can result in divine displeasure, manifesting as plagues, poor harvests, or other calamities.

### City Services and Culture

Building a zoo increases your city's culture rating[^ref-15], while other cultural buildings include:

- Libraries
- Schools
- Entertainment venues
- Gardens and beautification

The citizens are described as "much more Spartan than the Romans of Caesar"—meaning that "given food and protection from enemies, they are always happy and eager to please"[^ref-16]. This simplified citizen happiness system allows players to focus on construction and monument building.

### Monument Building

Pyramid building and floodplain management come together for what reviewers called "a brilliant city builder experience"[^ref-7]. Monument construction is a multi-stage process requiring:

1. Quarrying and transporting stone
2. Organizing labor forces
3. Managing construction logistics
4. Maintaining worker housing and services

The expansion introduces new monument types appropriate to the Cleopatra era, including Ptolemaic-style architecture that blends Egyptian and Greek elements.

### Cheat Codes

The game features various cheat codes that trigger unique events[^ref-17]:

- Plague outbreaks
- Festivals
- Immediate city destruction
- Resource bonuses

These cheats allow players to experiment with the game's systems or overcome difficult scenarios.

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| GameSpot | 8.2/10 | "It is a rare thing to find an expansion worthy of the original"[^ref-15] |
| Metacritic | 77/100 | Aggregate score from multiple critics[^ref-18] |
| GameRankings | 82% | Aggregate score[^ref-7] |
| GameFAQs | 9/10 | "It's the first game in months to keep me up till 3 am"[^ref-16] |
| Strategy Plus | 3.5/5 | "Pharaoh is one of the strongest examples of Janus-like gameplay"[^ref-19] |
| eeggs.com | 7.1/10 | Community rating[^ref-17] |
| MobyGames | 7.6/10 | User aggregate[^ref-1] |

GameSpot's Ron Dulin awarded the original Pharaoh (with which Cleopatra shares most systems) an 8.2/10, praising its engaging combination of city-building and monument construction[^ref-25].

### Critical Consensus

Critics praised the expansion for providing substantial new content that justified its purchase for Pharaoh fans. The 15 new missions, new buildings, and focus on the Cleopatra era gave players fresh challenges without fundamentally changing the successful formula.

Strategy Plus noted that "Pharaoh is one of the strongest examples of Janus-like gameplay"[^ref-19]—referring to the game's ability to appeal to both casual players enjoying the city-building aspects and hardcore strategists optimizing their economies.

### Modern Assessment

The expansion has maintained strong ratings over time. Modern reviews note that "A New Era elevates Pharaoh to modern standards spectacularly well"[^ref-20], while TheGamer rated the 2023 updated version 4/5 stars[^ref-20]. The game is consistently described as "A must-have expansion for any serious monument builder"[^ref-18].

GameFAQs users rate the game as "Great" based on 36 ratings[^ref-5], demonstrating continued appreciation from the community. Amazon customer reviews show a perfect 5.0/5 rating[^ref-27], though from a limited sample size.

## Development

### Origins

Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile was developed over approximately one year[^ref-7] by BreakAway Games as an expansion to their successful Pharaoh city-building game. BreakAway had established themselves as capable of expanding on Impressions Games' city-builder formula, and the Cleopatra expansion allowed them to explore a beloved historical period.

The decision to focus on Cleopatra provided both historical richness and name recognition—Cleopatra VII remains one of the most famous figures from ancient history.

### Production Team

The development team included key designers:

- **Alan Venable** - Design
- **Charles Kibler** - Design
- **Chris Beatrice** - Design[^ref-7]
- **Ed Beach** - Producer
- **Melissa Sawicki** - QA Lead

A total of 42 developers worked on the project[^ref-7], representing a substantial team for an expansion pack.

### Voice Cast

The game featured voice acting to bring its characters to life:

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| Jeremiah Kissel | Various characters[^ref-21] |
| Frank Ridley | Pharaoh[^ref-21] |

### Music

The musical score was composed by a team of four composers[^ref-7]:

- Henry Beckett
- Jennifer Maihack
- Keith Zizza
- Richard Hayman

The soundtrack evokes ancient Egypt through its instrumentation and melodic choices while maintaining the pleasant, unobtrusive quality appropriate for a city-builder that players might spend hours with.

### Technical Implementation

The game was built using a custom engine[^ref-7] based on the Caesar III framework, adapted for the Ancient Egyptian setting[^ref-14]. Technical specifications included:

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| Processor | Pentium 133 MHz minimum[^ref-22] |
| RAM | 32 MB[^ref-22] |
| Storage | 360 MB[^ref-22] |
| API | DirectDraw 6[^ref-22] |
| Color Depth | 16-bit[^ref-22] |
| Resolution | 640x480 native[^ref-22] |

A widescreen patch was later made available by the community[^ref-23], allowing modern players to enjoy the game at contemporary resolutions.

## Legacy

### Awards and Recognition

The game achieved notable recognition in the industry:

- **Finalist** for 'Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction' at the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards[^ref-7]
- **Gold Award** in Germany for selling over 100,000 units[^ref-7]

### Pharaoh Gold

Pharaoh and its Cleopatra expansion were later bundled together as "Pharaoh Gold" in 2001[^ref-7]. This bundle provided excellent value for new players and became the standard way to purchase the game as standalone Cleopatra copies became scarce.

### Pharaoh: A New Era (2023)

The series received a modern remake titled "Pharaoh: A New Era" in 2023[^ref-7], developed by Triskell Interactive and published by Dotemu. This remake includes updated graphics, quality-of-life improvements, and both the original Pharaoh content and the Cleopatra expansion in a single package.

TheGamer's review noted that "A New Era elevates Pharaoh to modern standards spectacularly well"[^ref-20], validating the enduring appeal of the original game design.

### City-Builder Genre Influence

Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile, along with its parent game Pharaoh, represents a high point in Impressions Games' city-builder series. The formula established in Caesar III and refined in Pharaoh/Cleopatra influenced numerous subsequent city-building games.

The monument-building mechanics, in particular, provided a distinctive hook that set the Egyptian setting apart from other historical city-builders.
