<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

Quest for Infamy is a hybrid point-and-click adventure game and RPG developed by Infamous Quests and released in 2014[^ref-1]. The game was created as a spiritual successor to Sierra's Quest for Glory series, allowing players to experience the classic adventure game formula from the perspective of an anti-hero rather than a traditional protagonist[^ref-2]. Built using Adventure Game Studio (AGS), Quest for Infamy deliberately evokes the classic Sierra adventure game aesthetic with hand-drawn graphics and full voice acting[^ref-3].

The game follows Mr. Roehm, a scoundrel on the run from his latest scrape who finds himself trapped in a valley until he completes a dangerous mission[^ref-4]. Originally conceived to take place in Spielburg Valley as the villain's perspective on Quest for Glory, the final released version takes place in an original setting but maintains the inspiration from Sierra's classic adventure games and RPGs of the 1990s[^ref-5]. The project was successfully funded through a Kickstarter campaign launched on July 6, 2012, marking the transition of the development team from fan remake creators to commercial game developers[^ref-6].

## Story Summary

Quest for Infamy centers around Mr. Roehm, a rogue who is trying to start his life over after running away from a shady past[^ref-1]. The protagonist finds himself in the town of Volksville, where he witnesses a public execution by the Sheriff and begins to integrate with the local community[^ref-9]. Roehm is not free to leave the valley until he completes a horrendously dangerous mission involving the mysterious Killington family story and a quest to eliminate the leader of the Morroi cult[^ref-10].

The game's narrative deliberately positions Roehm as an anti-hero rather than a traditional villain. As developer Steven Alexander explained, the character is "someone who is not a goody two shoes hero type, someone who is often on the wrong side of the law...but at heart is not a person of evil intent. Mostly just out for themselves"[^ref-7]. This Han Solo-type character allows players to "lie, cheat, and steal your way through tales of charming villainy with multiple endings"[^ref-11].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Quest for Infamy features a classic point-and-click interface that deliberately evokes Sierra's adventure games of the 1990s[^ref-12]. Players control the game using mouse input to interact with the environment, characters, and inventory[^ref-13]. The game includes over 200 rooms to explore and more than 50 NPCs to interact with throughout the adventure[^ref-13].

### Structure and Progression

The game follows a traditional adventure game structure with multiple acts, including detailed progression through Act One and Act Two with specific objectives and locations[^ref-9]. Players can choose their path to infamy by selecting one of three character classes: the sneaky rogue, the bold brigand, or the crafty sorcerer, each offering different gameplay approaches[^ref-14]. The game features multiple paths and branching storylines that create different experiences with each playthrough[^ref-14].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Quest for Infamy combines traditional point-and-click adventure puzzles with RPG elements[^ref-2]. The game includes a combat system, though reviews noted this as one of the weaker elements of the gameplay experience[^ref-15]. Players must navigate various challenges including infiltrating the Morroi stronghold through multiple approaches such as the front gate or sewers[^ref-10]. The game also features a unique item called 'Smeat' that can replenish health, increase maximum health, and provide infamy points[^ref-10].

## Reception

|-------------|-------|-------|
| RPG Fan | 80/100 | "A lovingly-crafted though flawed adventure in the Sierra mold"[^ref-12] |
| IGN Italia | 83/100 | Praised everything except fighting, map absence, and exploration freedom[^ref-16] |
| The Digital Fix | 70/100 | "An extremely rough diamond, buried under one too many layers of mess"[^ref-16] |
| GamingTrend | 70/100 | "A near perfect recreation of point-and-click adventure games of the past"[^ref-17] |

### Modern Assessment

Quest for Infamy received a Metacritic score of 63 on PC[^ref-18], indicating mixed to average reviews. The game was more favorably received by RPG-focused publications, with RPGFan giving it 80/100 and praising it as paying homage to Sierra's legacy[^ref-19]. User reviews have been more positive, with GOG.com showing a 3.9/5 rating from 41 reviews[^ref-4] and itch.io ratings of 4.8/5 and 4.5/5[^ref-11]. Modern console ports have received more critical assessments, with TheXboxHub giving it 2.5/5 and noting issues with voice acting quality[^ref-20].

## Development

### Origins

Quest for Infamy originated from the development team at Infamous Quests, which was founded in 2012 by former members of Infamous Adventures after their successful fan remakes of King's Quest III and Space Quest II[^ref-2]. The initial concept was to create a game where players could return to Spielburg Valley in the role of the villain, inspired by Sierra's Quest for Glory series[^ref-5]. However, the final version moved away from direct Quest for Glory connections to create an original setting while maintaining the inspirational elements[^ref-5].

### Production

The game was successfully funded through a Kickstarter campaign launched on July 6, 2012, allowing the team to transition from fan remake creators to commercial developers[^ref-6]. Development took approximately two years following the successful crowdfunding campaign[^ref-5]. The team adopted the motto "JUST FINISH IT" during development, recognizing that many similar fan projects failed due to being too team-driven without focused leadership[^ref-7].

Key development challenges included balancing the anti-hero character concept. As developer Shawn Mills explained: "One of the first things we realized is that evil and being a 'bad guy' are different things. Evil is by definition insanity. If we just allowed the player character to walk into a village and kill all the people, well...you can't tell much of a story from that point"[^ref-7].

### Technical Achievements

Quest for Infamy was created using Adventure Game Studio (AGS), the same engine used for many modern adventure game productions[^ref-3]. The game features hand-crafted retro-style graphics designed to evoke the classic era of adventure gaming[^ref-14]. The soundtrack, composed by James Mulvale and Ash 25, includes over 97 tracks supporting various atmospheric situations from light-hearted to epic, goofy to sinister[^ref-21]. The game includes full voice acting with a cast including Steve Patrick, Sean Pratt, Christian Bell, and Matthew C. Larsen[^ref-22].

## Legacy

Quest for Infamy won four Adventure Game Studio awards in 2014, including Best Character Lead for Roehm, Best Puzzles, Best Music & Sounds, and Best Gameplay[^ref-2]. The game was also nominated for Best Writing (Comedy) at the Aggie Awards and received Top 100 Nominations on IndieDB[^ref-2]. 

The success of Quest for Infamy demonstrated the viability of crowdfunded spiritual successors to classic Sierra adventure games. Developer Shawn Mills expressed enthusiasm for returning to the series, stating "Quest for Infamy is one of the greatest things I've done in my life, so I'd love to go back to that well again!"[^ref-7] The game has been ported to modern consoles including Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4/5, and Xbox platforms, published by Ratalaika Games in 2022[^ref-8].
