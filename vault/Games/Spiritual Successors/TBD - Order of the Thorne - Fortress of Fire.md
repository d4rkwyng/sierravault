# Order of the Thorne: Fortress of Fire

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 16, 2026</small>

## Overview

**Order of the Thorne: Fortress of Fire** is an unreleased point-and-click adventure game developed by [[Infamous Quests]], intended as the second and likely final installment in the *Order of the Thorne* fantasy anthology series[^ref-1]. First announced in 2015 following a successful Kickstarter campaign that raised $30,944, the game was designed as a direct sequel to *The King's Challenge* (2016) and promised to deliver a thrilling conclusion to the adventures in the magical land of Uir[^ref-2][^ref-3].

The game represents a significant departure from its predecessor, shifting focus from Finn the Bard to a new protagonist named Patrick, a young squire serving under the veteran knight Sir Caradoc of the Order of the Thorne[^ref-4]. The title was originally announced for release around 2020 but has remained in development limbo for years, with the developers acknowledging in 2025 that significant work remains to complete the project[^ref-5][^ref-6].

Infamous Quests, founded in 2012 by Steven Alexander and Shawn Mills, built their reputation on VGA remakes of classic Sierra adventures including *Space Quest II* and *King's Quest III* before transitioning to commercial development[^ref-7]. Their first original commercial title, *Quest for Infamy* (2014), established the studio's commitment to nostalgic adventure gaming, and *Fortress of Fire* was conceived as part of an ambitious expansion of their fantasy gaming universe[^ref-8].

## Story Summary

*Fortress of Fire* continues the fantasy narrative established in *The King's Challenge*, picking up after the events that concluded Finn the Bard's adventure in the land of Uir[^ref-2]. The story follows the protagonist and companions as they journey through the Glass Mountains toward the Valley of Sunlight, where a mysterious fortress has become the focal point of dark events threatening the magical realm[^ref-3].

The primary protagonist is Patrick, nicknamed "Addy," who serves as a young squire to Sir Caradoc, a seasoned veteran knight of the Order of the Thorne[^ref-4]. When Sir Caradoc becomes waylaid during their journey to explore the mysterious "Fortress of Fire," Patrick must rise to the occasion and embark on a quest to rescue his master[^ref-4]. This narrative shift allows the game to explore themes of duty, growth, and heroism from a different perspective than the bardic adventures of the first installment.

The Land of Sunlight, once a vibrant and magical region, has found its homes blighted and dark under an unknown threat[^ref-2]. Players must uncover the enemy's plans and find a way to save both the valley and the entire magical world of Uir from the encroaching darkness[^ref-3]. The fortress itself serves as the central location and primary obstacle, requiring Patrick to work his way through a dark and desolate land, solving puzzles and riddles while meeting fantastic characters[^ref-4].

The story was designed to provide closure to the *Order of the Thorne* anthology while expanding the lore and world-building established in the first game[^ref-1]. However, according to later developer commentary, the original vision for the series included more mature and developed story elements that were scaled back during the production of *The King's Challenge*[^ref-5].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

*Fortress of Fire* utilizes traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics consistent with the Sierra-inspired design philosophy that defines Infamous Quests' catalog[^ref-3]. The game features a third-person perspective with stylized 2D art presentation, maintaining visual consistency with its predecessor[^ref-1]. The control scheme supports both mouse-based point-and-click interaction and touch controls for potential portable platforms[^ref-1].

### Structure and Progression

The game follows Patrick's journey from the Glass Mountains to the Valley of Sunlight and ultimately into the Fortress of Fire itself[^ref-3]. The progression system involves:

- **Glass Mountains:** The initial journey phase where Patrick and companions travel toward their destination
- **Valley of Sunlight:** The blighted region that serves as the primary exploration area
- **The Fortress of Fire:** The climactic location where Patrick must rescue Sir Caradoc[^ref-4]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Like its predecessor, *Fortress of Fire* emphasizes puzzle-solving as its core gameplay mechanic[^ref-3]. Players must solve puzzles and riddles while navigating the game world[^ref-4]. The game was designed to feature musical puzzle-solving elements, with the protagonist's lute serving as a problem-solving tool—a mechanic carried over from Finn's adventures in *The King's Challenge*[^ref-3]. However, with Patrick as the protagonist rather than Finn the Bard, the implementation of musical mechanics may differ from the first installment.

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

As *Fortress of Fire* remains unreleased, no contemporary reviews exist for this specific title. However, the reception to the first *Order of the Thorne* game provides context for the series:

*The Order of the Thorne: The King's Challenge* received a Metascore of 71 based on 6 critic reviews, indicating "Mixed or Average" reception[^ref-10]. ActionTrip awarded it 80/100, praising it as "an old-school point-and-click adventure without the old-school frustration"[^ref-10]. Ragequit.gr gave it 74/100, calling it "a heartfelt, if not groundbreaking tribute to the King's Quest games of yore"[^ref-10]. Adventure Gamers scored it 70/100, describing it as "a solid Golden Age-style fairy tale adventure"[^ref-10].

### Modern Assessment

The user reception for *The King's Challenge* was notably more positive than critical reception, with Steam showing "Very Positive" reviews (85% positive from 100 user reviews)[^ref-11] and a Metacritic User Score of 8.0 based on 7 ratings[^ref-10].

The developer has acknowledged in retrospective commentary that the reception to *The King's Challenge* "wasn't what we hoped it would be at the time"[^ref-5]. This lukewarm commercial performance has been cited as a contributing factor to the prolonged development of *Fortress of Fire*[^ref-5].

**Aggregate Scores (The King's Challenge):**
- **Metacritic:** 71/100 (6 critic reviews)[^ref-10]
- **Metacritic User Score:** 8.0/10 (7 ratings)[^ref-10]
- **Steam:** 85% Positive (100 reviews)[^ref-11]

## Development

### Origins

*Fortress of Fire* emerged from Infamous Quests' ambitious 2015 Kickstarter campaign, which sought funding for both a new *Order of the Thorne* adventure and a prequel to *Quest for Infamy* titled *Roehm to Ruin*[^ref-7][^ref-8]. The campaign successfully concluded on May 3, 2015, raising $30,944 plus additional funds via PayPal, which allowed the team to announce *Fortress of Fire* as a stretch goal achievement—the third game to emerge from the campaign[^ref-2].

The series was conceived as an anthology of standalone adventures set in the fairy realm of Uir, with each installment featuring different protagonists and stories while sharing the same magical world[^ref-1][^ref-12]. This approach allowed the developers to explore various characters and narrative tones within a unified setting, similar to classic anthology adventure series.

### Production

Development of *Fortress of Fire* has been characterized by significant delays and shifting priorities. Following the release of *The King's Challenge* in January 2016, work on the sequel proceeded slowly as the Infamous Quests team members took on other employment[^ref-6]. In a 2020 update, the developer acknowledged the slow progress, stating that team members "now work other jobs" but were "assembling assets and building the game in the engine"[^ref-3].

By 2026, the game remained in what the developers described as "a real state of limbo"[^ref-5]. According to developer Steven Alexander's Patreon update from October 2025, the team has "a lot of resources done for Fortress of Fire but a lot more need to be done - mostly animations"[^ref-5]. The backgrounds are reportedly in the engine, and work has begun on developing the story path and puzzles[^ref-2].

**Development Credits:**[^ref-7]
- **Project Lead:** Steven "Blackthorne" Alexander
- **Co-Founder:** Shawn Mills
- **Team Member:** James "Broomie" Broom

### Technical Achievements

The game utilizes Adventure Game Studio (AGS), the same engine that powered *Quest for Infamy* and *The King's Challenge*[^ref-7]. This engine choice reflects the studio's commitment to creating authentic retro-style adventures with hand-painted backgrounds in 320x200 resolution, consistent with the Golden Age aesthetic that defined Sierra's classic adventure games[^ref-12].

### Technical Specifications

**Planned Specifications:**[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- **Resolution:** 320x200 (scaled for modern displays)
- **Art Style:** Stylized 2D hand-painted backgrounds
- **Engine:** Adventure Game Studio
- **Distribution:** Internet Download

### Cut Content

In a revealing 2026 Patreon post, developer Steven Alexander discussed how the original vision for the *Order of the Thorne* series was significantly altered during production of *The King's Challenge*[^ref-5]. According to Alexander, the team "had story ideas and elements for Order of the Thorne that were more developed and what one might say were more mature"[^ref-5]. 

The developers were given "bad counsel" to create a "family friendly" game similar to *King's Quest*, leading to what Alexander described as a "bowdlerized version" of the original design[^ref-5]. Specifically, "the rougher more mature edges were trimmed off, and things like character death were removed from the game"[^ref-5]. The developers have discussed the possibility of creating a "Director's Cut" of *The King's Challenge* that would restore more of the original intent[^ref-5].

### Version History

| Version | Date | Platform | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| N/A | Announced 2015 | Windows/Mac/Linux | Kickstarter stretch goal achieved[^ref-2] |
| In Development | 2020+ | Windows/Mac/Linux | Assets being assembled[^ref-3] |
| Development Limbo | 2026 | Windows/Mac/Linux | Backgrounds complete, animations needed[^ref-5] |

### Technical Issues

As the game remains unreleased, no technical issues have been documented. The prolonged development has been attributed to resource constraints rather than technical challenges, with team members working other jobs while developing the game in their spare time[^ref-3][^ref-5].

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

While specific easter eggs for *Fortress of Fire* cannot be documented due to the game's unreleased status, the *Order of the Thorne* series was designed to exist within Infamous Quests' shared universe, potentially containing references to *Quest for Infamy* and the studio's earlier Sierra remakes[^ref-7][^ref-8].

The developers have discussed potentially combining *The King's Challenge* and *Fortress of Fire* into a single unified game called simply "Order of the Thorne" upon the sequel's completion[^ref-2].

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

The commercial performance of *The King's Challenge* significantly impacted the development trajectory of *Fortress of Fire*. In July 2016, Infamous Quests announced they would be stepping back from adventure game development after completing their remaining committed projects (*Roehm to Ruin* and *Fortress of Fire*), citing insufficient revenue from Kickstarter campaigns and game sales to cover development costs[^ref-6].

Despite successful crowdfunding campaigns, including the 2012 campaign that raised $63,281 for *Quest for Infamy*[^ref-7], the financial returns proved unsustainable for full-time development[^ref-6]. The developer noted that "the people that play adventure games now and in particular point and click adventure games are not families" and that targeting a family-friendly audience may have been a strategic misstep[^ref-5].

### Collections

The developers have discussed plans to eventually release a combined version containing both *The King's Challenge* and *Fortress of Fire* as a single complete anthology[^ref-2].

### Fan Projects

Community members have expressed ongoing interest in the game's completion, with comments on the itch.io page spanning from 2021 to 2026 inquiring about development progress[^ref-3]. Early access to development versions has been made available to Patreon supporters[^ref-3].

### Related Publications

No official hint books or strategy guides have been announced for *Fortress of Fire* due to its unreleased status.

### Critical Perspective

*Fortress of Fire* represents both the ambitions and limitations of small independent studios attempting to revive classic adventure gaming. Infamous Quests' journey from amateur Sierra remakes to commercial development exemplifies the passion-driven nature of the adventure game revival movement of the 2010s[^ref-7][^ref-8].

The game's prolonged development limbo illustrates the challenges facing nostalgic indie projects: critical acclaim and crowdfunding success do not always translate to sustainable commercial viability[^ref-6]. The developers' candid reflections on creative compromises—particularly the decision to pursue a "family friendly" approach that may have alienated their core audience of adult adventure gaming enthusiasts—offers valuable insight into the tensions between market assumptions and actual player demographics[^ref-5].

The *Order of the Thorne* series, even incomplete, demonstrates that the Sierra adventure formula continues to inspire developers and attract dedicated audiences, even if the commercial realities of modern game development make such projects increasingly difficult to sustain[^ref-12][^ref-14].
