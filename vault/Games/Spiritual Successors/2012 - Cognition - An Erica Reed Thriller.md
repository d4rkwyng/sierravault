## Story Summary

The game centers on Erica Reed, an FBI agent working in Boston who specializes in serial murder cases.[^ref-4] Erica possesses a rare psychic gift that allows her to see certain past events when she touches or focuses on objects.[^ref-2][^ref-12] As the game's description states: "FBI agent Erica Reed has an ability to see certain past events. A man with dark secrets has been murdered by hanging. A hidden message at the crime scene leads Erica to believe that the serial killer who killed her brother isn't dead."[^ref-13]

Throughout the episodic series, Erica learns to control three distinct psychic powers: cognition, projection, and regression.[^ref-4] The story features "an uncomfortably dark narrative"[^ref-14] that explores themes of supernatural investigation and personal trauma. Each episode presents a different serial killer case while building toward the resolution of the central mystery surrounding her brother's death.

### Episode Structure

| Episode | Title | Release Date | Focus |

| Episode 2 | The Wise Monkey | January 30, 2013 | Continuing the trail[^ref-15] |
| Episode 3 | The Oracle | May 15, 2013 | "A potent murder mystery where questions continue to arise"[^ref-3] |
| Episode 4 | The Cain Killer | September 19, 2013 | Series conclusion[^ref-15] |

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Cognition employs a traditional third-person point-and-click adventure interface.[^ref-17] The game utilizes mouse controls for navigation and interaction[^ref-11], maintaining classic adventure game conventions while incorporating modern design elements. Players control Erica as she investigates crime scenes and interacts with various characters throughout Boston.

The game is described as "a captivating 3rd-person point-and-click adventure game set in a thrilling narrative"[^ref-17], with comic book-style artwork complementing the noir atmosphere.[^ref-5]

### Psychic Powers

Erica's supernatural abilities serve as both investigation tools and puzzle-solving mechanisms:

| Power | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Cognition** | See past events by touching objects |
| **Projection** | Project memories onto the environment |
| **Regression** | Travel deeper into past events |

These powers allow players to reconstruct crime scenes and uncover hidden clues by interacting with relevant objects.[^ref-5][^ref-4] One review noted: "Her supernatural abilities are an advantage in investigating but a curse for her future."[^ref-18]

### Structure and Progression

Each episode offers approximately 5 hours of gameplay[^ref-11] and functions as a complete investigative story while contributing to the overall narrative arc. The game incorporates player choices that affect story progression[^ref-4], adding replay value and narrative branching.

Traditional adventure game elements such as inventory management, character dialogue, and environmental puzzle-solving complement the psychic investigation mechanics.

## Development

### Origins

Cognition emerged from Phoenix Online Studios' desire to create their first commercial adventure game project.[^ref-4] The development team sought to capture the spirit of classic adventure games while incorporating modern storytelling techniques and supernatural thriller elements.

The game was successfully funded through a Kickstarter campaign that raised $30,000.[^ref-5][^ref-11]

**Music:**
The atmospheric music was composed by Austin Haynes, Matthew Florianz, and Robert Holmes.[^ref-25] The Phoenix Online Store describes it: "From tense shootouts to melancholy moments, the atmospheric music of Austin Haynes sets the mood for Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller."[^ref-25]

## Legacy

Cognition established [[Phoenix Online Studios]] as a legitimate developer in the adventure game space and demonstrated the viability of episodic adventure gaming funded through crowdsourcing.[^ref-14] The game's success led to speculation about a potential second season[^ref-1], though no official announcements have been made.

The series has been recognized with Aggie Award nominations[^ref-15] and continues to be available through digital distribution platforms, ensuring its preservation for future adventure game enthusiasts.

### Sierra Connection

Cognition represents an important spiritual successor to Sierra's classic adventure games, particularly the [[1993 - Gabriel Knight - Sins of the Fathers|Gabriel Knight]] series. With Jane Jensen as story consultant and themes echoing Gabriel Knight's supernatural investigations, the game carries forward Sierra's legacy of narrative-driven adventure gaming. Phoenix Online Studios itself originated from fan projects recreating King's Quest games, further cementing the Sierra connection.[^ref-5]
