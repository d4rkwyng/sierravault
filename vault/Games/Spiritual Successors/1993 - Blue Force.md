## Overview

**Blue Force** is a 1993 point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Tsunami Games. Designed by [[Jim Walls]], the creator of the [[Series/Police Quest|Police Quest]] series at Sierra On-Line, Blue Force serves as a spiritual successor to the original Police Quest trilogy, featuring similar police procedural gameplay in a new setting with a new protagonist.[^ref-1]

The game follows Jake Ryan, a rookie police officer in the fictional town of Jackson Beach who uncovers clues to his father's unsolved murder while working his first days on the force.[^ref-2] Like its Police Quest predecessors, Blue Force emphasizes realistic police procedures, evidence gathering, and proper protocol—hallmarks of Jim Walls' design philosophy.[^ref-3]

Blue Force reunited several former Sierra employees who had joined Tsunami Media, including composer [[Ken Allen]] (King's Quest V, Space Quest IV) and artist [[Peter Ledger]] (Conquests of Camelot), creating a game that felt distinctly like a Sierra adventure in everything but name.[^ref-4]

## Story

Set in 1995, Blue Force puts players in the role of Jake Ryan, whose father—also a police officer—was killed in the line of duty in 1984. The murder was never solved, and Jake's decision to join the Jackson Beach Police Department stems partly from a desire to follow in his father's footsteps and partly from a need to find answers.[^ref-2]

Jake graduates at the top of his academy class and joins the same department where his father served. His first days on the job prove eventful, as he makes several arrests connected to a National Guard armory break-in. Just as Jake begins connecting these crimes to his father's cold case, he's seriously injured in a motorcycle accident while on patrol.[^ref-2]

After recovering, Jake's father's former partner offers him a position at his private investigation firm. Working together, they uncover a massive gun smuggling operation involving three main conspirators: Bradford Green, District Attorney Stuart Cox, and Nico Dillon—the man who murdered Jake's father. The game culminates in bringing all three to justice, with Nico receiving a death sentence for the murder.[^ref-2]

## Gameplay

Blue Force plays much like the early Police Quest games that established Jim Walls' reputation. Players navigate Jake through his police duties using a point-and-click interface accessed via a badge-shaped command menu activated by the right mouse button.[^ref-3]

Standard police work forms the game's backbone: gathering evidence, booking suspects, filing reports, and remembering radio codes to call for backup or report incidents. Unlike the Police Quest series, Jake patrols on a motorcycle rather than in a squad car, though players simply click on a map to travel between locations rather than driving manually.[^ref-3]

The game features digitized actors for characters, a technique that Hardcore Gaming 101 notes was "handled far better than it was in [Police Quest: Open Season]." Backgrounds remain hand-drawn, and the overall presentation maintains visual coherence despite the mixed media approach.[^ref-3]

Blue Force was released on both floppy disk and CD-ROM. Despite being a CD release, the CD version contains no voice acting—only an audio interview with Jim Walls as bonus content.[^ref-3]

## Development

### Tsunami Games and Sierra Alumni

Tsunami Games (also known as Tsunami Media) was founded by former Sierra On-Line CFO Ed Heinbockel and was headquartered in Oakhurst, California—the same small mountain town that housed Sierra's headquarters.[^ref-5] The company attracted numerous former Sierra employees, making it something of a Sierra diaspora.

Jim Walls joined Tsunami in 1992 after leaving Sierra following the release of Police Quest III: The Kindred (1991).[^ref-5] The circumstances of his departure from Sierra have never been officially documented, but he would only create one game for Tsunami before moving on to other companies.[^ref-5]

### The TsAGE Engine

Blue Force was built on the TsAGE (Tsunami Adventure Game Engine), developed by Robert Eric Heitman, Eric Hart, John Rettig, Chris Hoyt, John Crane, and John Hamilton—several of whom had worked at Sierra.[^ref-4] The engine powered multiple Tsunami adventure games including the Ringworld series.

### Sierra Veterans on Staff

The development team included several notable Sierra alumni:[^ref-4]

- **[[Ken Allen]]** composed the music score and sound effects, bringing his expertise from Sierra titles like King's Quest V, Space Quest IV, and The Colonel's Bequest
- **[[Peter Ledger]]** contributed background renderings, having previously worked on Conquests of Camelot at Sierra
- **Robert Eric Heitman** and **Chris Hoyt** handled game programming, both former Sierra programmers
- **Eric Hart** contributed to the TsAGE engine development

Jim Walls himself makes a cameo appearance in the game as a worker at the city records department.[^ref-3]

## Reception

Blue Force received mixed to negative reviews upon release. Computer Gaming World's Charles Ardai wrote in 1993 that the game "is simply not as strong as Walls' previous games," criticizing the game world as "prop-up facades" and calling the dialogues "abysmal" with "appalling spelling errors and factual inconsistencies."[^ref-1] Ardai concluded that "Walls and Tsunami both have better work in them... they have nowhere to go but up."[^ref-1]

PC Format's 1993 review complained about restrictive progression requiring trial and error and repetitive bureaucracy, ultimately concluding that "some good sequences and average graphics" were outweighed by "clicking on the mouse to keep the conversation moving, too many sudden deaths, a storyline that's way too tight, sterile unpopulated settings, characters walking at a snail's pace and no apparent logic in some situations."[^ref-1]

In 1996, Computer Gaming World placed Blue Force at #37 on their list of the worst computer games ever released, comparing the writing to "the worst episode of the TV show CHiPs."[^ref-1][^ref-3]

Despite the harsh critical reception, the game shipped 20,000 units in its first month.[^ref-1] Modern retrospectives have been somewhat kinder, with Hardcore Gaming 101 noting it's "not really a bad game, just a dated one" and calling it "a must for Police Quest fans, although most others will find its charms elusive."[^ref-3]

## Legacy

Blue Force represents Jim Walls' final completed adventure game and his only work for Tsunami Games. After leaving Tsunami, Walls contracted with Tachyon Studios and Philips Interactive Media for games that were never released.[^ref-5]

Walls later joined Westwood Studios in 1996, contributing to Blade Runner (1997), Pirates: The Legend of Black Kat (2002), and Earth & Beyond (2002) before being let go when Electronic Arts acquired and closed the studio in 2003.[^ref-5]

In 2013, Walls attempted to crowdfund **Precinct**, a spiritual successor to Police Quest, but the Kickstarter campaign failed to reach its $500,000 goal and was canceled early. A subsequent open fundraising campaign also failed, never surpassing $7,000.[^ref-5]

Despite its troubled reception, Blue Force remains historically significant as a window into what Police Quest might have looked like had Walls continued the series. It stands alongside SpaceVenture, Hero-U, and Colossal Cave 3D as evidence that Sierra's creative talent continued making Sierra-style games long after leaving the company.

## Purchase

Blue Force is currently considered abandonware and is available through various preservation sites. It has not received an official digital re-release on platforms like GOG or Steam.
