# Blue Force

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 12, 2026</small>

## Overview

Blue Force is a 1993 point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Tsunami Games, designed by [[Jim Walls]]—the creator of Sierra On-Line's acclaimed [[Series/Police Quest|Police Quest]] series[^ref-1]. Serving as a spiritual successor to the original Police Quest trilogy, Blue Force features similar police procedural gameplay in a new setting with a new protagonist, representing what Hardcore Gaming 101 called "an alternate version of Police Quest 4"[^ref-2].

The game follows Jake Ryan, a rookie police officer in the fictional town of Jackson Beach, who uncovers clues to his father's unsolved murder while working his first days on the force[^ref-1]. Like its Police Quest predecessors, Blue Force emphasizes realistic police procedures, evidence gathering, and proper protocol—hallmarks of Jim Walls' design philosophy that earned the original Police Quest series use as actual police training material[^ref-2].

Blue Force reunited several former Sierra employees who had joined Tsunami Media, including composer [[Ken Allen]] (King's Quest V, Space Quest IV) and artist [[Peter Ledger]] (Conquests of Camelot), creating a game that felt distinctly like a Sierra adventure in everything but name[^ref-3]. Despite mixed critical reception—Computer Gaming World later named it the 37th-worst game of all time—Blue Force shipped 20,000 units in its first month and remains historically significant as Jim Walls' final completed adventure game[^ref-1].

## Story Summary

Set in 1995, Blue Force puts players in the role of Jake Ryan, whose father—also a police officer—was killed in the line of duty in 1984[^ref-1]. The murder was never solved, and Jake's decision to join the Jackson Beach Police Department stems partly from a desire to follow in his father's footsteps and partly from a need to find answers.

Jake graduates at the top of his academy class and joins the same department where his father served. His first days on the job prove eventful, as he makes several arrests connected to a National Guard armory break-in[^ref-1]. Just as Jake begins connecting these crimes to his father's cold case, he's seriously injured in a motorcycle accident while on patrol.

After recovering, Jake's father's former partner offers him a position at his private investigation firm. Working together, they uncover a massive gun smuggling operation involving three main conspirators: Bradford Green, District Attorney Stuart Cox, and Nico Dillon—the man who murdered Jake's father[^ref-1]. The game culminates in bringing all three to justice, with Nico receiving a death sentence, Bradford Green sentenced to 20 years, and Stuart Cox receiving 15 years in prison[^ref-1].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Blue Force employs a point-and-click interface accessed via a badge-shaped command menu activated by the right mouse button[^ref-2]. The interface follows conventions established by Sierra's SCI-era games, though built on Tsunami's proprietary TsAGE (Tsunami Adventure Game Engine)[^ref-3].

The game features digitized actors for characters, a technique that Hardcore Gaming 101 notes was "handled far better than it was in [Police Quest: Open Season]"[^ref-2]. Backgrounds remain hand-drawn, and the overall presentation maintains visual coherence despite the mixed media approach. The animated looping portraits during dialogue "look a little bit silly, but overall it still looks fairly cohesive"[^ref-2].

### Structure and Progression

Blue Force plays much like the early Police Quest games that established Jim Walls' reputation. Players navigate Jake through his police duties, performing standard police work that forms the game's backbone: gathering evidence, booking suspects, filing reports, and remembering radio codes to call for backup or report incidents[^ref-2].

Unlike the Police Quest series, Jake patrols on a motorcycle rather than in a squad car, though players simply click on a map to travel between locations rather than driving manually[^ref-2]. The game structure follows Jake through his career progression from rookie patrol officer to private investigator, with the overarching murder mystery providing narrative momentum.

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Rather than traditional adventure game puzzles, Blue Force challenges players with authentic police procedures[^ref-2]. Success requires following proper protocol, though Hardcore Gaming 101 noted one curious omission: "it's odd that you never have to lock up your gun in a locker outside of the jail, something which the first three Police Quest games pummeled into you"[^ref-2].

Jim Walls himself makes a cameo appearance in the game as a worker at the city records department[^ref-2].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Blue Force received mixed to negative reviews upon release. Computer Gaming World's Charles Ardai wrote in 1993 that the game "is simply not as strong as Walls' previous games," criticizing the game world as "prop-up facades" and calling the dialogues "abysmal" with "appalling spelling errors and factual inconsistencies"[^ref-1]. Ardai concluded that "Walls and Tsunami both have better work in them... they have nowhere to go but up"[^ref-1].

PC Format's 1993 review complained about restrictive progression requiring trial and error and repetitive bureaucracy, concluding that "some good sequences and average graphics" were outweighed by "clicking on the mouse to keep the conversation moving, too many sudden deaths, a storyline that's way too tight, sterile unpopulated settings, characters walking at a snail's pace and no apparent logic in some situations"[^ref-1].

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Computer Gaming World | Negative | "Simply not as strong as Walls' previous games"[^ref-1] |
| PC Format | Mixed | "Some good sequences" but too many issues[^ref-1] |
| CGW Worst List (1996) | #37 | Named 37th-worst computer game ever released[^ref-1] |

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospectives have been somewhat kinder. Hardcore Gaming 101 noted Blue Force "is not really a bad game, just a dated one" and called it "a must for Police Quest fans, although most others will find its charms elusive"[^ref-2]. The review compared the writing to "the worst episode of the TV show CHiPs"—"That comparison isn't too far off base, but it's not really a bad game"[^ref-2].

Despite the harsh critical reception, the game shipped 20,000 units in its first month, indicating commercial viability even as critics panned it[^ref-1].

## Development

### Origins

Tsunami Games (also known as Tsunami Media) was founded by former Sierra On-Line CFO Ed Heinbockel and was headquartered in Oakhurst, California—the same small mountain town that housed Sierra's headquarters[^ref-4]. The company attracted numerous former Sierra employees, making it something of a Sierra diaspora.

Jim Walls joined Tsunami in 1992 after leaving Sierra following the release of Police Quest III: The Kindred (1991)[^ref-4]. The circumstances of his departure from Sierra have never been officially documented, but Blue Force would be his only game for Tsunami before moving on to other companies[^ref-4].

### Production

Blue Force was built on the TsAGE (Tsunami Adventure Game Engine), developed by Robert Eric Heitman, Eric Hart, John Rettig, Chris Hoyt, John Crane, and John Hamilton—several of whom had worked at Sierra[^ref-3]. The engine powered multiple Tsunami adventure games including the Ringworld series.

The development team included several notable Sierra alumni[^ref-3]:
- **[[Ken Allen]]** composed the music score and sound effects, bringing his expertise from Sierra titles like King's Quest V, Space Quest IV, and The Colonel's Bequest
- **[[Peter Ledger]]** contributed background renderings, having previously worked on Conquests of Camelot at Sierra
- **Robert Eric Heitman** and **Chris Hoyt** handled game programming, both former Sierra programmers
- **Cheryl Loyd** served as Art Director

The game was released on both floppy disk and CD-ROM. Despite being a CD release, the CD version contains no voice acting—only an audio interview with Jim Walls as bonus content[^ref-2].

### Technical Specifications

- **Platform:** MS-DOS
- **Engine:** TsAGE (Tsunami Adventure Game Engine)
- **Graphics:** VGA (256 colors), digitized actors with hand-drawn backgrounds
- **Audio:** Sound Blaster compatible
- **Distribution:** Floppy disk and CD-ROM (CD includes interview with Jim Walls)

## Legacy

Blue Force represents Jim Walls' final completed adventure game and his only work for Tsunami Games. After leaving Tsunami, Walls contracted with Tachyon Studios and Philips Interactive Media for games that were never released[^ref-4].

Walls later joined Westwood Studios in 1996, contributing to Blade Runner (1997), Pirates: The Legend of Black Kat (2002), and Earth & Beyond (2002) before being let go when Electronic Arts acquired and closed the studio in 2003[^ref-4].

In 2013, Walls attempted to crowdfund **Precinct**, a spiritual successor to Police Quest, but the Kickstarter campaign failed to reach its $500,000 goal and was canceled early. A subsequent open fundraising campaign also failed, never surpassing $7,000[^ref-4].

Despite its troubled reception, Blue Force remains historically significant as a window into what Police Quest might have looked like had Walls continued the series. It stands alongside [[2022 - SpaceVenture|SpaceVenture]], [[2018 - Hero-U - Rogue to Redemption|Hero-U]], and [[2023 - Colossal Cave 3D Adventure|Colossal Cave 3D]] as evidence that Sierra's creative talent continued making Sierra-style games long after leaving the company.

## Purchase
