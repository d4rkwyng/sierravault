 Cluck Yegger in Escape from the Planet of the Poultroid

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

*Cluck Yegger in Escape from the Planet of the Poultroid* is a comedic horror strategy game developed and published by Guys From Andromeda LLC, released on November 9, 2015[^ref-1]. The game serves as a parody of the popular *Five Nights at Freddy's* franchise, featuring similar survival horror mechanics with a humorous science fiction twist involving mutant chickens[^ref-2]. Created by [[Mark Crowe]] and Chris Pope—with Crowe being one half of the legendary "Two Guys from Andromeda" who created the *Space Quest* series at Sierra On-Line—the game represents a spiritual continuation of their comedic adventure game legacy[^ref-3].

The game was developed as an offshoot of the much larger *SpaceVenture* project, which was successfully funded through Kickstarter in 2012 with $539,767 from 10,809 backers[^ref-4]. When development on *SpaceVenture* experienced delays due to personal circumstances affecting Scott Murphy, the team created *Cluck Yegger* as both a Halloween-themed gift to backers and a means of generating additional funding for the main project[^ref-2]. The mini-game was initially released exclusively to Kickstarter backers on October 29, 2015, before becoming publicly available on Steam and other platforms shortly thereafter[^ref-6].

Despite its origins as a small side project, *Cluck Yegger* developed its own following among fans who appreciated its blend of tension and humor. The game features full voice acting, original music, and a "Tame Mode" option that replaces traditional jump scares with a cat dressed in a chicken costume, making it accessible to younger players[^ref-1]. User reviews consistently praised it as a parody that exceeded its source material, with one reviewer declaring it "Cheaper than FNAF, Better than FNAF"[^ref-7].

## Story Summary

The game follows the adventures of Cluck Yegger, a space-faring "Free-Ranger" who operates under the authority of the Galactic FDA[^ref-10]. As the story opens, Yegger is hailing Planet Poultroid to announce an inspection of operations: "Eggcelsior hailing Planet Poultoid... This is Cluck Yegger, Free-Ranger, Under authority of the galactic FDA, you are hereby ordered to cease operations for my inspection"[^ref-10]. However, his mission goes catastrophically wrong when he is shot out of the sky by his arch nemesis, Colonel Zanderz[^ref-3].

Colonel Zanderz, a villain designed as a parody of KFC founder Colonel Sanders[^ref-11], operates a sinister chicken factory called "BFC" on Planet Poultroid[^ref-1]. After crash-landing in front of this facility, Yegger finds himself stranded with a disabled ship that runs only on limited auxiliary solar power that charges during the daytime[^ref-3]. This leaves him trapped in his cockpit at night, forced to defend himself against unwelcome visitors from the factory.

The factory has been producing genetically modified creatures called "Poultroids"—mutated cyborg chickens that roam the night looking for prey[^ref-12]. As Yegger grimly acknowledges: "it looks like I'll have to spend my nights playing 'poultroid peekaboo' with a brood of my mutated cousins"[^ref-10]. The player must help Yegger survive seven consecutive nights against these peckish poultry predators until his ship accumulates enough solar charge to escape. When Zanderz discovers his nemesis has survived the crash, he gleefully taunts: "Well... cock-doodle-doo! ...if it ain't my most prized Chicken. Come home to roost. I do declare"[^ref-11].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The gameplay mechanics closely mirror those of the original *Five Nights at Freddy's* game[^ref-2]. Players are confined to a first-person view from within Cluck Yegger's crashed spacecraft cockpit, where they must monitor the approach of hostile Poultroids using limited resources[^ref-3]. The interface includes a security camera system that allows players to track enemy movements throughout the facility, door controls for blocking access points, a shield system for emergency defense, and a scanning function[^ref-12].

The game uses a simple control scheme where players interact with various defensive systems while managing their limited power supply. Some players reported difficulty with the controls, particularly on Linux systems where looking left and right to access door controls did not function properly for some users[^ref-7]. The camera system displays views of different areas where the mutant chickens may be approaching from, requiring constant vigilance[^ref-12].

### Structure and Progression

The game spans seven in-game nights, compared to the five nights in the original *FNAF* games[^ref-7]. Each night begins at 7:00 p.m. and the player must survive until sunrise at 7:00 a.m. the next day[^ref-1]. In real-time, each night lasts approximately five minutes[^ref-2]. The difficulty escalates with each successive night as the Poultroids become more aggressive and numerous in their attacks.

- **Nights 1-2:** Introduction to basic mechanics, relatively slow enemy movement
- **Nights 3-4:** Increased aggression and frequency of attacks
- **Nights 5-6:** Multiple simultaneous threats requiring careful resource management
- **Night 7:** Final survival challenge before escape becomes possible

The game culminates with Yegger successfully accumulating enough solar power to escape Planet Poultroid, delivering his triumphant catchphrase: "I survived the night. Because of course I did"[^ref-13].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Unlike traditional adventure games, *Cluck Yegger* focuses on real-time resource management and threat assessment rather than inventory puzzles[^ref-3]. The core challenge involves balancing the use of power-draining defensive systems—cameras, doors, shields, and scanners—against the ship's limited nighttime power reserves[^ref-12]. Using any system depletes power, and running out of power before dawn leaves Yegger defenseless against the Poultroids.

The game includes a unique "Tame Mode" option designed to make the experience more accessible to younger or more sensitive players[^ref-1]. When enabled, this mode replaces the traditional jump scares that occur when a Poultroid catches the player with the image of a cat dressed in a chicken costume, significantly reducing the horror element while maintaining the strategic gameplay[^ref-1]. The developers conducted playtesting with children ages 10 and up to ensure the kid-friendly mode was appropriately accessible[^ref-3].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

*Cluck Yegger in Escape from the Planet of the Poultroid* received generally positive reviews from players, though it garnered limited attention from major gaming publications due to its nature as a small indie side project. Rock Paper Shotgun covered the game's release, noting that "Cluck Yegger is, bizarrely, a game about mutant chickens, and promises (optional) jump scares"[^ref-6]. The gaming news site Cliqist ran a feature announcing that the "Five Nights at Freddy's Parody Cluck Yegger Gets Release Date" and suggested the game "Will Make You Scream and Shout"[^ref-14].

Steam user reviews were notably enthusiastic, with players praising the game's humor and production values. One reviewer stated: "As parodies go... it's one of those parodies that's better than the original product"[^ref-7]. Another user simply declared: "Cheaper than FNAF, Better than FNAF"[^ref-7]. A third reviewer praised the production quality: "Funny stuff! The voice acting is absolute gold"[^ref-15]. However, not all reviews were positive—one Spanish-language reviewer gave the game a harsh 0/10, writing "Una pena de juego. 0-10. evítenlo aún en bundles" (A shame of a game. 0-10. Avoid it even in bundles)[^ref-7].

Some reviewers appreciated the atmospheric tension despite the comedic setting: "Never thought the sound of clucking in the dark could be so fear inducing!"[^ref-7]. Community members consistently defended the game against accusations of being merely a *FNAF* clone, with one user noting: "This is a parody, not a rip-off"[^ref-7], while another reminded critics that "This is only a small minigame from the Upcoming 'Spaceventure'. Not designed to be a full game"[^ref-7].

### Modern Assessment

The game has maintained a respectable reputation among fans of both the *Space Quest* legacy and the *Five Nights at Freddy's* genre. On Steam, the game holds an 81% positive rating based on 43 user reviews[^ref-3]. The itch.io page shows a more modest 3.0 out of 5 stars rating[^ref-15]. Alchetron's aggregated score shows an impressive 9.8/10, though this appears to be from a limited sample[^ref-2].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **Steam:** 81% positive (43 reviews)[^ref-3]
- **itch.io:** 3.0/5 stars[^ref-15]
- **Alchetron:** 9.8/10[^ref-2]
- **App Store (mobile):** 4.75/5[^ref-16]

Metacritic has a page for the game but shows no professional critic reviews available[^ref-17].

## Development

### Origins

The genesis of *Cluck Yegger* lies in the broader *SpaceVenture* project, a Kickstarter campaign launched by the Two Guys from Andromeda—[[Mark Crowe]] and Scott Murphy—to create a spiritual successor to their beloved *Space Quest* series[^ref-4]. The campaign, which ran under the banner "Two Guys SpaceVenture - by the creators of Space Quest," reminded backers: "Remember the Space Quest series from Sierra's duo the Two Guys From Andromeda? Well they are back & making a brand new SpaceVenture™!"[^ref-4]

When the main *SpaceVenture* project experienced significant delays due to Scott Murphy needing to step away for personal reasons, the remaining team sought ways to maintain momentum and engagement with their backers[^ref-1]. The popularity of *Five Nights at Freddy's* inspired them to create a parody game using characters and settings already developed for *SpaceVenture*, resulting in *Cluck Yegger*[^ref-2]. The character of Cluck Yegger had already been designed as part of the *SpaceVenture* universe, making him a natural protagonist for this side project[^ref-3].

### Production

Development of *Cluck Yegger* lasted approximately seven months and was completed by an extremely small team[^ref-2]. Chris Pope handled the primary programming duties with support from Patrick Johnston, who had previously worked on the fan-made *Space Quest: Vohaul Strikes Back*[^ref-1]. Mark Crowe focused on the game's distinctive artwork, assisted by additional artists[^ref-2]. The team built the game using the Unity 4 engine (specifically build 4.6.9f1), allowing for cross-platform deployment[^ref-8].

The game was released first to Kickstarter backers on October 29, 2015, timed as a Halloween treat[^ref-6]. It then went through Steam Greenlight before receiving full public release on November 9, 2015[^ref-2]. The decision to sell the game publicly, rather than keeping it exclusively for backers, was made to generate additional funding for the ongoing *SpaceVenture* development[^ref-7]. The initial price was set at $2.99[^ref-12].

### Technical Achievements

The game was built on the Unity 4 engine, enabling deployment across multiple platforms including Windows, macOS, Linux, and iOS[^ref-8]. The developers emphasized accessibility, implementing the innovative "Tame Mode" that replaces jump scares with humorous imagery, making the survival horror experience available to younger audiences[^ref-1].

The audio design received particular attention, with composer Ken Allen—a veteran of numerous Sierra games—providing the musical score[^ref-2]. The voice acting was highlighted by multiple reviewers as a standout feature, with the lead character's performance described as reminiscent of Patrick Warburton's distinctive style[^ref-7]. The game included radio segments with a singer and newscaster that added atmosphere and world-building[^ref-18].

### Cut Content

- **German Availability:** The game was removed from the German Steam store due to lacking a Steam Age Rating[^ref-12]
- **Missing Executable:** Some users reported missing game executable after download[^ref-12]

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

The game is filled with references and in-jokes that fans of the developers' previous work would appreciate:

- **Colonel Zanderz** is a direct parody of KFC founder Colonel Sanders, complete with Southern dialect and chicken-themed villainy[^ref-11]
- **Joe Swanson Reference:** The game reportedly includes a reference to the *Family Guy* character[^ref-7]
- **Cat Transformation:** In Tame Mode, a down taunt transforms Yegger into a cat, and jump scares are replaced with a cat in a chicken costume[^ref-13]
- **Prime Number Joke:** Yegger's line "Great! I hate prime numbers" appears during gameplay[^ref-13]
- **Galactic FDA:** The protagonist works for a parody of the real-world Food and Drug Administration, policing food production across the galaxy[^ref-10]

## Voice Cast

| Character | Voice Actor |
|-----------|-------------|
| Cluck Yegger | Mike Schiff[^ref-18] |
| Colonel Zanderz | Mark Crowe (as "Wilcofever")[^ref-18] |
| Radio Singer | Josh Mandel[^ref-18] |
| Radio Newscaster | Chris Pope[^ref-18] |

The voice acting was consistently praised by reviewers as one of the game's strongest elements[^ref-15]. Mike Schiff's performance as Cluck Yegger was compared favorably to Patrick Warburton's distinctive style[^ref-7]. Josh Mandel, who voiced King Graham in Sierra's *King's Quest V* and *VI*, contributed vocal performances for the in-game radio segments[^ref-18].

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Specific sales figures for *Cluck Yegger* are limited, though the mobile version through WorldsApps recorded 998 downloads[^ref-16]. The game was priced at $2.99 on Steam[^ref-12] and was also made available through itch.io[^ref-15]. While not a major commercial release, the game successfully fulfilled its purpose of providing content to *SpaceVenture* backers and generating additional development funding[^ref-7].

The game achieved Steam Greenlight approval, indicating sufficient community interest to warrant official distribution on the platform[^ref-2]. It maintained availability on Steam, itch.io, and mobile platforms, though it was removed from the German Steam store due to age rating classification issues[^ref-12].

### Collections

*Cluck Yegger* was primarily distributed as a standalone digital title and has not been included in any major compilation packages. It remains connected to the *SpaceVenture* project, with characters appearing in both games[^ref-23].

### Fan Projects

The character of Cluck Yegger has been adopted by the fan community in unexpected ways. A fan-created wiki documents Cluck Yegger as a playable character in the *Universe of Smash Bros. Lawl* fan game modification, complete with a full moveset based on his abilities from the original game[^ref-13]. The character is classified as a "Zoner" playtype with a cowardice rating of "0/10" and the note that he takes no damage from ion storms because he "is THAT awesome"[^ref-13].

### Related Publications

No official hint books or strategy guides were published for *Cluck Yegger*. As a relatively straightforward survival horror parody with a seven-night structure, the game did not require extensive documentation beyond the basic controls explained in-game.

### Critical Perspective

*Cluck Yegger in Escape from the Planet of the Poultroid* represents an interesting footnote in the history of adventure gaming—a project created by Sierra veterans during the development of a larger spiritual successor to their classic work. While the game itself is a modest parody of the *Five Nights at Freddy's* phenomenon rather than a traditional adventure game, it demonstrates how the creators of *Space Quest* adapted their comedic sensibilities to contemporary gaming trends.

The game's significance lies primarily in its connection to the Two Guys from Andromeda and their ongoing efforts to continue their legacy outside of Sierra. It showcases their characteristic humor, with chicken-themed puns and science fiction parody elements reminiscent of *Space Quest*'s irreverent tone. The inclusion of voice acting from [[Josh Mandel]], who had worked on classic Sierra titles, further reinforces the connection to adventure gaming's golden age.

As a standalone product, *Cluck Yegger* succeeded in what it set out to do: provide an entertaining diversion for fans while generating support for the larger *SpaceVenture* project. Its positive reception, particularly among those familiar with the developers' pedigree, suggests that the Two Guys' comedic voice remained appealing to audiences decades after *Space Quest* first launched.
