## Overview

SpaceVenture is a science fiction comedy adventure game developed by the Two Guys from Andromeda, the original creators of Sierra's classic Space Quest series[^ref-1]. After a brief 25+ year hiatus, Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy joined forces once again to create this spiritual successor to their beloved adventure game franchise[^ref-2]. The game follows Ace Hardway, a "Life Support Systems technician" (essentially a space plumber), and his robotic dog Rooter on an epic intergalactic misadventure[^ref-3].

Originally announced in April 2012 and successfully funded through Kickstarter in June 2012 with $539,767[^ref-4], SpaceVenture experienced a tumultuous decade-long development cycle marked by numerous delays, technical challenges, and personal setbacks for the developers[^ref-5]. The game finally released to Kickstarter backers in September 2022[^ref-6]. On December 23, 2025, the team publicly released SpaceVenture v2 (v2.08.01) on Steam, featuring a complete Unity engine upgrade, extensive QA testing, and numerous bug fixes[^ref-18].

## Story Summary

SpaceVenture takes players on a sci-fi comedy adventure that combines interplanetary exploration, puzzle-solving, and space travel, featuring "pant loads" of pop culture satire and clean "potty" humor characteristic of the Space Quest series[^ref-7]. The game follows protagonist Ace Hardway, described as a space plumber or "Life Support Systems technician," accompanied by his robotic companion Rooter[^ref-3]. The narrative maintains the irreverent tone and pop culture references that made the original Space Quest games memorable, with various easter eggs and parodies throughout the experience[^ref-9].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls
SpaceVenture utilizes a traditional point-and-click adventure game interface reminiscent of classic Sierra titles[^ref-10]. The game features a "point and select" control scheme with a third-person perspective[^ref-7]. However, reviewers have noted significant issues with the user interface, with one critic describing it as "a daft user interface" that detracts from the overall experience[^ref-11].

### Structure and Progression
The game is described as offering "a cohesive adventure game experience and story that is playable from start to finish"[^ref-12]. Players navigate through various sci-fi environments solving puzzles in the traditional adventure game style. The developers have maintained their philosophy that "this is a Two Guys From Andromeda game, and that means one thing for sure, you're going to need a keycard if you want to get through a closed door at some point!"[^ref-13]

### Puzzles and Mechanics
SpaceVenture incorporates the quirky puzzles and offbeat humor that characterized the original Space Quest series[^ref-9]. The game includes memorable death sequences, a retro adventure gaming interface, and hand-crafted artwork designed to make players "feel right at home"[^ref-9]. However, technical implementation has been problematic, with one reviewer noting that "the biggest flaw with the interface, however, is the save system. What a hot mess."[^ref-1]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Adventure Game Hotspot | 65% | Criticized lack of polish but praised core humor and story[^ref-1] |
| Chordian.net | 6/10 | Called it "a buggy mess with a daft user interface"[^ref-11] |
| Impulse Gamer | 4/10 | Noted nostalgic appeal but technical issues[^ref-10] |
| Steam User Reviews | 92% Very Positive | Current user rating shows strong fan support[^ref-3] |
| Critics (Aggregate) | 72% | Overall critical reception[^ref-7] |

### Modern Assessment

The game has received mixed to negative reviews from critics, with many praising the nostalgic elements and humor while criticizing the technical execution. Adventure Game Hotspot's reviewer noted: "It's a shame that the lack of polish really lets it down in its current state, as at its core SpaceVenture is a funny, good-looking game with an interesting story that will surely be enough to satisfy Space Quest fans"[^ref-1]. John Walker of Kotaku was more harsh, calling the final product "a colossal disaster"[^ref-14]. Despite critical issues, Steam users have rated the game very positively at 92%, suggesting strong fan appreciation despite technical flaws[^ref-3].

## Development

### Origins
The reunion of Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe began in 2012 when Mark reached out to Scott after their 20-year estrangement following their work on Space Quest[^ref-8]. Murphy later reflected: "Mark had the guts to reach out to somebody who he had no reason to feel might welcome him -- me" and admitted "Looking back, I realize I was a dick"[^ref-8]. The two creators were inspired by Double Fine's successful Kickstarter campaign and realized they needed to work together again, with Crowe stating: "We knew there was no way we were going to be able to make a Space Quest-style game that was successful unless we were together"[^ref-8].

The project's conception reflected the nostalgia wave sweeping through crowdfunded gaming. As the Two Guys themselves stated: "We aren't straying from what has been a successful formula. We're back to make more while also incorporating what we've learned from you via comments made from the days of snail-mail and moving to email and social media"[^ref-9]. They acknowledged fan feedback, noting "It's been interesting to learn what you've found fun, funny and/or annoying, and what games you've favored. Clearly, not everyone has well-rated taste, but we can work around that"[^ref-9].

### Production
Development began after a successful Kickstarter campaign launched on June 12, 2012, which exceeded its $500,000 goal and raised $539,767[^ref-4]. The initial delivery was estimated for February 2013, but the project experienced numerous delays due to technical challenges with the Unity engine, personal hardships, and lack of development expertise[^ref-5]. The team faced significant setbacks when "Mark and Chris both lost their mothers during a span of time in the last few months," contributing to development delays[^ref-15].

### Voice Cast

The game features an impressive ensemble of voice talent, many with notable gaming and animation credits:

| Actor | Known For |
|-------|-----------|
| Rob Paulsen | Pinky (Pinky and the Brain), Yakko (Animaniacs)[^ref-4] |
| Maurice LaMarche | Brain (Pinky and the Brain), Egon Spengler (The Real Ghostbusters)[^ref-4] |
| Robert Clotworthy | Jim Raynor (StarCraft series)[^ref-4] |
| Ellen McLain | GLaDOS (Portal series)[^ref-4] |
| John Patrick Lowrie | Sniper (Team Fortress 2)[^ref-4] |
| Jason Charles Miller | Composer and voice actor[^ref-4] |
| Melanie Stone | Mythica series[^ref-4] |
| Jake Stormoen | Mythica series, Outpost[^ref-4] |
| Vince Caso | Voice actor[^ref-4] |
| Ed Kelly | Narrator[^ref-1] |

Gary Owens, the iconic narrator from the original Space Quest series, was originally planned to reprise his role. Tragically, Owens passed away before recording could take place, leaving the team to find a replacement narrator[^ref-4]. The voice recordings were eventually completed by August 2018, representing six years of intermittent production work[^ref-4].

Music for the game was composed by Ken Allen (a Sierra veteran who worked on the original Space Quest games), James Mulvale, and Jason Charles Miller[^ref-4].

### Technical Achievements
SpaceVenture was developed using the Unity engine and features traditional 2D background art combined with real-time 3D characters and particle effects[^ref-7]. The game targets a default resolution of 1920x1080 with fullscreen mode support[^ref-7]. However, development was hampered by challenges upgrading from older Unity engine versions, and the final product suffered from numerous technical issues including a problematic save system and limited resolution options[^ref-1].

As one reviewer summarized: "It feels like the producers just pushed it out the door because ten years of production was long enough, and no other fixes were forthcoming"[^ref-1]. The troubled development serves as "a cautionary tale about crowdfunded game development, illustrating how game dev is really hard and that Kickstarter money doesn't stretch very far in a dev cycle of literally a decade"[^ref-16].

### Version History

| Version | Date | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| v2.08.01 | December 23, 2025 | Major v2 release with Unity engine upgrade and extensive bug fixes[^ref-18] |
| v2.08.02 | December 26, 2025 | Patch fixing Pipes scene bug[^ref-3] |

The v2 development cycle involved four phases: transitioning to the latest Unity version, multiple QA testing rounds, beta testing with backers ($30+ pledges), and final release to all eligible backers ($15+ pledges)[^ref-18]. The team also announced plans to add Steam achievements[^ref-3].

## Legacy

SpaceVenture represents a cautionary tale about crowdfunded game development, illustrating how "game dev is really hard and that Kickstarter money doesn't stretch very far in a dev cycle of literally a decade"[^ref-16]. Despite its troubled development and mixed critical reception, the game has found appreciation among fans of the original Space Quest series, as evidenced by the strong Steam user ratings of 92% positive[^ref-3].

### Lessons Learned

The project's decade-long development cycle highlighted several challenges facing nostalgia-driven crowdfunded projects:

- **Scope vs. Budget**: The $539,767 raised proved insufficient for the ambitious scope envisioned
- **Technical Expertise**: The team lacked dedicated programming expertise, leading to Unity engine struggles
- **Personal Setbacks**: Deaths in the families of key team members contributed to delays
- **Engine Updates**: Upgrading between Unity versions proved technically challenging

### Reunion Impact

The project served to reunite the original Space Quest creators after a 20-year estrangement, healing old wounds and allowing Murphy and Crowe to collaborate once more. Despite the game's mixed reception, the personal reconciliation between the Two Guys represents a meaningful outcome beyond the game itself.

### Activision Connection

The developers attempted to contact Activision about working on an official Space Quest title but never received a response[^ref-17]. This reflects the broader challenge facing classic franchise revivals—original creators often find it difficult to re-engage with properties now owned by large publishers.

### Ongoing Development

The team has continued supporting the game post-release, with v2 updates in late 2025 addressing many technical issues that plagued the initial release[^ref-18]. Plans for Steam achievements indicate ongoing commitment to improving the player experience[^ref-3].
