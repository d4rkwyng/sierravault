# Order of the Thorne: The King's Challenge

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

**Order of the Thorne: The King's Challenge** is a point-and-click adventure game developed by Infamous Quests and released in 2015[^ref-1]. Described as "a classic point-and-click adventure inspired by the iconic King's Quest series"[^ref-2], the game serves as a spiritual successor to Sierra's beloved adventure games of the 1980s and 1990s[^ref-3]. Players take control of Finn the Bard, a young musician who participates in the Faerie King's annual challenge to find the missing queen and compose "the greatest ballad ever"[^ref-4].

The game was successfully crowdfunded through Kickstarter and represents part of the modern retro adventure game revival movement that emerged in the 2010s[^ref-5]. Built using the Adventure Game Studio (AGS) engine, it features hand-drawn pixel art reminiscent of 1990s adventure games and incorporates classic Sierra-style gameplay with inventory puzzles and world exploration[^ref-6].

Adventure Gamers praised the nostalgic design, with one reviewer noting "This feels as much like a 1991 release as you could hope for"[^ref-6]. The game achieves its goal of recapturing the magic of classic Sierra adventures while adding unique elements like musical puzzle-solving through Finn's magical lute.

## Story Summary

### The Setting

Set in the magical Faerie Kingdom, the story centers around a beloved royal tradition. "Every ten years, the ruler of the Faerie Realm, King Quilhairn, offers up his latest challenge to those brave enough to undertake the quest"[^ref-8]. The kingdom exists in a world of magic, talking animals, and ancient mysteries—a setting deliberately evocative of Sierra's fantasy adventures.

### The Challenge

The challenge appears deceptively simple at first glance: "The King of the Faerie Kingdom has gathered various heroes from the land to find his Queen. No, no, don't worry; she hasn't been kidnapped or anything, this is just a simple game of hide-and-seek"[^ref-9]. Queen Ancell has hidden herself somewhere within the realm, and contestants must locate her to claim victory.

However, as the game's description hints, "all is not as it seems, and the true challenge lies ahead"[^ref-12]. What begins as a lighthearted competition gradually reveals deeper mysteries about the Faerie Kingdom and its rulers.

### Finn's Motivation

The protagonist, Finn the Bard, enters the competition with his own artistic motivation—"Finn's own reason for participating is to be inspired into composing the greatest ballad in the world"[^ref-10]. Unlike other contestants seeking power or glory, Finn hopes the adventure will spark his creative genius.

### The Prize

The reward for completing the challenge is significant: "One wish, any wish that is within his power to grant"[^ref-11]. King Quilhairn's magical power makes this an extraordinary prize, drawing contestants from across the land to test their wits and courage.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The game employs traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics that will be immediately familiar to fans of classic Sierra games. Players navigate using keyboard and mouse, with controller support also available for those who prefer gamepad input[^ref-5].

The interface includes:
- **Inventory management** for collecting and combining items
- **Dialogue trees** for conversing with characters
- **Examination commands** for investigating the environment
- **Musical interface** for playing Finn's lute

### Display and Graphics

The game supports modern display options including[^ref-5]:
- Widescreen resolution support
- Windowed mode
- Borderless fullscreen windowed
- 60 FPS and 120+ FPS support

The base resolution of 320x200 recreates the look of classic VGA-era adventures, with pixel art graphics that deliberately evoke the golden age of Sierra adventure gaming[^ref-5].

### Structure and Progression

Order of the Thorne: The King's Challenge is relatively short compared to classic adventure games, designed as the first episode in a planned anthology series. According to HowLongToBeat statistics[^ref-8]:

| Completion Type | Average Time |
|----------------|--------------|
| Main Story | 3.5 hours |
| Completionist | 4 hours |
| Speedrun | ~2 hours |

This episodic length allows for focused storytelling while setting the stage for future installments in the series.

### Musical Puzzle System

A unique feature that sets Order of the Thorne apart from its inspirations is the musical puzzle system. Players can "Use your lute to perform musical songs to solve puzzles and complete tasks"[^ref-14]. The game instructs players to "Play your magic lute to discover the secrets of the land and entertain its people"[^ref-15].

This mechanic draws direct inspiration from LucasArts' classic Loom, featuring "a music 'mini-game' similar to Loom"[^ref-16]. Finn must learn and perform melodies to:

- Unlock magical effects
- Communicate with certain characters
- Solve environmental puzzles
- Progress through key story moments

The lute system adds a creative dimension to puzzle-solving beyond traditional inventory manipulation.

### Classic Adventure Puzzles

Beyond the musical elements, the game includes traditional adventure game puzzles involving:
- Item collection and combination
- Environmental interaction
- Character dialogue and information gathering
- Exploration and discovery

The puzzle difficulty aims for accessibility while providing satisfying challenges for adventure game veterans.

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Adventure Gamers | 3.5/5 | Praised nostalgic design elements[^ref-6] |
| Cubed3 | 4/10 | Criticized as overly simplistic[^ref-9] |
| GOG.com User Reviews | 4.1/5 | Based on 28 user reviews[^ref-4] |
| IMDb | 8.2/10 | User ratings[^ref-17] |
| itch.io | 4.4/5 | Platform user reviews[^ref-11] |
| HowLongToBeat | 64% | User satisfaction rating[^ref-8] |

### Critical Analysis

The critical reception was divided. Adventure Gamers praised the successful recreation of classic Sierra aesthetics: "This feels as much like a 1991 release as you could hope for"[^ref-6]. The review appreciated the attention to detail in recreating the look and feel of games like King's Quest.

However, Cubed3's Athanasios Aravositas was more critical, giving the game only 4/10 and describing it as overly simplistic[^ref-9]. This represents the challenge facing retro-style games: balancing nostalgia with providing meaningful engagement for modern players.

### Community Response

User reception has been generally positive among fans of classic Sierra-style adventures. One GOG.com user noted, "Playing this game was like going back in time to the good old King's Quest days"[^ref-4]. The game has been particularly recommended for nostalgia-seeking players, with reviewers stating "if you're a fan of the old Sierra style adventures you'll love this one"[^ref-18].

The 4.1/5 rating on GOG.com based on 28 reviews and 4.4/5 on itch.io suggests the target audience—fans of classic adventure games—responded favorably to the game's approach.

## Development

### Studio Background

Order of the Thorne: The King's Challenge was developed by Infamous Quests, an independent studio that began as "originally an amateur developer of VGA game remakes"[^ref-3]. The studio built its reputation by creating fan remakes of classic Sierra games before moving on to original titles.

### Crowdfunding

The game was "successfully funded through Kickstarter" and developed "with community feedback"[^ref-5]. This crowdfunding approach allowed the small studio to pursue their vision of creating a classic-style adventure game while involving fans in the development process.

The Kickstarter backers received various rewards and their involvement is commemorated in the game through Easter eggs.

### Production Team

The development team drew inspiration from "classic adventure games from Sierra and LucasArts"[^ref-5].

## Legacy

A sequel titled "Fortress of Fire" has been mentioned as in development[^ref-3], promising to continue the episodic adventure format.

As one reviewer concluded, "While still a bit on the short side, The King's Challenge is a polished game and perfectly sets the stage for the next installment"[^ref-3].

### Easter Eggs and Fan Service

The game includes Easter eggs celebrating its crowdfunding origins:
- "Isle of the Honored with Kickstarter backer tombstones"[^ref-20]
- "Village library with books credited to Kickstarter backers"[^ref-20]

These touches demonstrate the developers' appreciation for the community that supported the game's creation.

### Contribution to the Adventure Game Revival

Order of the Thorne represents part of the broader indie adventure game revival of the 2010s. Alongside other spiritual successors and crowdfunded adventures, it demonstrates continued audience interest in classic point-and-click gameplay. The game's success helped validate the market for new games in the Sierra style, encouraging other developers to pursue similar projects.
