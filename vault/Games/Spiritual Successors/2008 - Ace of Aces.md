# Ace of Aces

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 12, 2026</small>

## Overview

> [!warning] Not to Be Confused
> This page covers the 2008 browser-based flight game by Mad Otter Games. This is **not** the 1986 Accolade game "Ace of Aces" developed by Artech, which was a completely different World War I flight game for 8-bit computers.[^ref-1]

Ace of Aces is a 2008 browser-based World War I dogfighting game developed by Mad Otter Games and published through the InstantAction platform[^ref-2][^ref-3]. The game was designed by [[Damon Slye]], co-founder of Dynamix and creator of Sierra On-Line's legendary flight simulation series including [[1990 - Red Baron|Red Baron]], [[1992 - Aces of the Pacific|Aces of the Pacific]], and [[1993 - Aces Over Europe|Aces Over Europe]][^ref-4][^ref-5].

Ace of Aces represented Slye's return to flight combat games after a 12-year hiatus from the gaming industry[^ref-6]. Having left Dynamix in 1994 to pursue other interests—including obtaining his pilot's license and flying his own Bonanza A36 aircraft—Slye founded Mad Otter Games in 2007 with fellow ex-Dynamix employees in Eugene, Oregon[^ref-7][^ref-8]. The game served as a spiritual successor to his earlier WWI flight sim Red Baron, bringing his signature approach to accessible flight combat to the then-emerging browser gaming market[^ref-9][^ref-10].

The game launched on the InstantAction platform in 2008 and featured both single-player training modes and competitive multiplayer battles[^ref-2]. When InstantAction shut down in November 2010, Ace of Aces became unavailable, with planned re-release efforts never materializing[^ref-11][^ref-12].

## Setting

Ace of Aces takes place during World War I, the conflict that gave birth to aerial combat as a new dimension of warfare[^ref-2]. Players take to the skies over the Western Front, engaging in dogfights reminiscent of the legendary aerial battles between Allied and Axis powers[^ref-2][^ref-18].

Unlike the detailed historical campaigns of Damon Slye's earlier Red Baron, Ace of Aces focused on competitive multiplayer action rather than narrative progression[^ref-9]. The setting served primarily as an atmospheric backdrop for fast-paced dogfighting, with period-appropriate biplane fighters providing the visual and gameplay framework[^ref-2].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The game featured browser-based controls optimized for accessibility, allowing players to jump into aerial combat without extensive tutorials or complicated keybindings[^ref-15]. This streamlined approach reflected Slye's evolved design philosophy, moving away from the simulation-heavy complexity of his earlier work toward broader accessibility[^ref-6].

### Core Experience

Ace of Aces is a World War I dogfighting game where players fly fighter planes and attempt to score points by shooting down enemy aircraft or destroying enemy ground targets[^ref-2]. Players can choose to fly for either the Axis or Allied powers, piloting period-appropriate biplane fighters in aerial combat over stylized WWI battlefields[^ref-2][^ref-14].

The game featured intuitive browser-based controls designed to be accessible to casual players while still offering depth for more dedicated flight sim enthusiasts[^ref-15]. This balance between accessibility and simulation depth was a hallmark of Damon Slye's design philosophy, which he later articulated: "I'm a real pilot, and I understand all the intricacies of flight and weather and airplanes, but I want to bring in many more people. Right now many flight sims are really daunting to new players. The controls are difficult."[^ref-6]

### Game Modes

**Single-player Training Mode**

The single-player component offered two tutorial missions designed to teach new players the fundamentals[^ref-2]:

- **Marksmanship Tutorial:** Taught basic flight controls and aerial combat targeting
- **Ground Attack Tutorial:** Instructed players on techniques for assaulting enemy ground installations

**Multiplayer Battle Mode**

The primary focus of Ace of Aces was competitive multiplayer, featuring five distinct game modes[^ref-2]:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Team Dogfight | Team-based aerial combat with coordinated squadron tactics |
| Furball | Free-for-all dogfighting melee |
| Fox and Hounds | Asymmetric pursuit mode |
| Rescue the Spy | Capture-the-flag variant with objective-based gameplay |
| Base War | Strategic mode focused on destroying enemy installations |

### Technical Implementation

Ace of Aces ran through the InstantAction platform's browser plugin, a compact 150KB download that enabled console-quality 3D graphics directly in web browsers[^ref-15][^ref-16]. The underlying technology utilized the Torque Game Engine, developed by GarageGames—a company founded by other Dynamix veterans including Mark Frohnmayer and Jeff Tunnell[^ref-13][^ref-17].

The InstantAction platform was designed to deliver "core-oriented mechanics and high-end visuals" through streaming technology that broke game downloads into small chunks, allowing players to begin playing before the full game was downloaded[^ref-13][^ref-16].

## Development

### Origins: Mad Otter Games

After leaving Dynamix in 1994, Damon Slye spent 12 years away from the gaming industry[^ref-6][^ref-7]. During this sabbatical, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from the University of Oregon and obtained his pilot's license, buying a Bonanza A36 single-engine aircraft that he flew up and down the West Coast[^ref-7][^ref-18].

By 2006, Slye felt the pull to return to game development. As he later explained: "It was a pretty good life. It was fun until about 2007. Then I just got bored. I thought, what's the point? This is dumb. I miss making games. I like working with a team of creative people."[^ref-9]

The catalyst for his return came unexpectedly. Slye was driving through downtown Eugene, Oregon when his former Dynamix co-founder Jeff Tunnell walked across the crosswalk in front of him. "I yelled out the window, 'Hey Jeff!'" Slye recalled. "And he replied, 'Hey Damon, want to make games again?'"[^ref-6]

Slye founded Mad Otter Games in 2007, assembling a team of talented developers, many with roots at Dynamix[^ref-3][^ref-19]. The studio was based in Eugene, Oregon—the same city that had been home to Dynamix for nearly two decades[^ref-3].

### The InstantAction Platform

InstantAction emerged from GarageGames, which was founded in 2000 by Dynamix veterans after Sierra shut down the studio in 2001[^ref-13][^ref-17]. The company had licensed the source code to the Tribes 2 game engine from Sierra and developed it into the commercially successful Torque Game Engine[^ref-17].

In September 2007, media mogul Barry Diller's IAC (InterActiveCorp) acquired GarageGames and announced the creation of InstantAction.com[^ref-13][^ref-16]. The platform's goal was to deliver graphically impressive multiplayer action games directly through web browsers—a revolutionary concept at the time[^ref-15][^ref-16].

"We've been looking at the video game sector for years and it wasn't until we found GarageGames and their idea for InstantAction.com that we believed IAC could participate in a true internet innovation in online gaming," said Barry Diller at the announcement[^ref-16].

InstantAction launched its open beta on March 31, 2008, with Ace of Aces among its initial slate of games[^ref-14][^ref-15]. Other launch titles included Marble Blast, Think Tanks, and Fallen Empire: Legions—a spiritual successor to Tribes developed by GarageGames itself[^ref-15][^ref-20].

### Platform Shutdown

InstantAction's life was short-lived. Louis Castle, co-founder of Westwood Studios, became CEO in July 2009 as the company restructured[^ref-21]. In March 2010, InstantAction.com was taken down as a gaming portal, with the company pivoting to support embedding 3D games on external websites[^ref-14].

On November 11, 2010, InstantAction announced it was "winding down" operations entirely[^ref-11][^ref-14]. The platform's closure meant all its hosted games, including Ace of Aces, became instantly unavailable[^ref-11].

### Re-release Efforts

Shortly after InstantAction's shutdown, Mad Otter Games announced plans to re-release Ace of Aces through a dedicated website at AceofAcesthegame.com[^ref-2][^ref-12]. The website launched in November 2010 with a news post stating "the website is ready to take her maiden flight!"[^ref-12]

However, the game itself was never re-released. The website hasn't been updated since 2010, and no forum posts from the developers have appeared[^ref-11]. As of 2013, Slye indicated continued interest in reviving the game, but no concrete progress has materialized[^ref-11]. The game remains unavailable to play.

## Reception

Given the game's browser-based distribution and relatively short lifespan, formal critical reviews of Ace of Aces are scarce. The game existed primarily within the InstantAction ecosystem, where it served as one of the platform's marquee titles demonstrating the capability for action-oriented 3D games in web browsers[^ref-15].

Contemporary coverage focused more on the technological achievement of the InstantAction platform than individual games. TechCrunch's March 2008 preview of InstantAction noted the platform's ability to deliver "graphically complex games that appeal to competitive gamers" directly in browsers[^ref-15].

GamesIndustry.biz's coverage of Mad Otter Games described Ace of Aces as a "browser-based flight simulation" representing the studio's commitment to "putting the fun into our games"[^ref-3].

The game's legacy is perhaps best understood through its context: it represented Damon Slye's return to the flight combat genre that had made him famous, demonstrating that the creator of Red Baron and Aces of the Pacific still had the passion for WWI aerial combat even after more than a decade away from the industry[^ref-6][^ref-9].

## Legacy

### Mad Otter's Continued Journey

After Ace of Aces, Mad Otter Games shifted focus to Villagers and Heroes (originally titled "A Mystical Land"), a free-to-play MMORPG that launched in 2011[^ref-3][^ref-22]. Unlike Ace of Aces, Villagers and Heroes found lasting success, growing from a player base of twenty people to over 20,000 active players and continuing to receive updates as of 2026[^ref-4][^ref-22].

### The Red Baron Revival Attempts

Slye's passion for WWI flight combat didn't end with Ace of Aces. In October 2013, he launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund a full remake of Red Baron, seeking $250,000 to create a game featuring both single-player campaigns and multiplayer modes including MOBA-styled maps and tech trees[^ref-6][^ref-23].

The Kickstarter failed, reaching only $21,908 of its goal[^ref-6]. Slye later attributed the failure to poor campaign execution: "We didn't build a community before we launched the Kickstarter. We didn't present it very well. The game didn't look right. It looked a little arcade-ey."[^ref-9]

A subsequent 2015 effort to raise $50,000 for a prototype also failed to gain traction[^ref-9]. Despite these setbacks, the continued attempts demonstrate Slye's enduring connection to the WWI flight combat genre he helped define.

### Sierra Connection

Ace of Aces represents a direct line of succession from Sierra On-Line's Dynamix studio to the modern independent gaming scene. The game embodies the "Sierra diaspora" phenomenon—talented developers who cut their teeth at Sierra spreading throughout the industry and continuing to create games in the genres they helped establish[^ref-17].

The connections run deep:
- **Mad Otter Games** was founded by Dynamix co-founder Damon Slye[^ref-4]
- **InstantAction/GarageGames** was founded by other Dynamix veterans including Jeff Tunnell and Mark Frohnmayer[^ref-13][^ref-17]
- The **Torque Game Engine** powering Ace of Aces descended from Dynamix's Tribes 2 engine[^ref-17]
- The game was created in **Eugene, Oregon**, the same city that housed Dynamix for 17 years[^ref-3]

## Technical Specifications

- **Platform:** Web browser (requires InstantAction plugin)[^ref-2]
- **Engine:** Torque Game Engine[^ref-13]
- **Plugin Size:** ~150KB initial download[^ref-15]
- **Graphics:** 3D, near-console quality for its era[^ref-15][^ref-16]
- **Multiplayer:** Yes, team-based and free-for-all modes[^ref-2]
- **Current Status:** Unavailable (platform defunct since November 2010)[^ref-11]

## Purchase

> [!warning] Unavailable
> Ace of Aces is no longer available to play. The game was exclusive to the InstantAction browser platform, which shut down on November 11, 2010[^ref-11]. Despite plans to re-release the game through a dedicated website, the game has never been made available again[^ref-12].

No digital storefronts carry Ace of Aces, and no physical releases exist. The game's browser-based architecture means it cannot be preserved through traditional means like emulation or abandonware distribution.
