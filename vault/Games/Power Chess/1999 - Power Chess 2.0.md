<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 16, 2026</small>

## Overview

Power Chess 2.0 is a chess simulation game developed and published by [[Sierra On-Line]] in 1999 for Windows[^ref-1]. As the third entry in the Power Chess series, the game represented "the culmination of a long history of chess games that have ranged from Radio Shack hand-held computer chess games to IBM's Deep Blue"[^ref-2]. The game allowed players to compete against computer opponents or challenge human players over the Internet, featuring multiple AI personalities modeled after famous chess grandmasters including Gary Kasparov, Bobby Fischer, Judit Polgar, and Anatoly Karpov[^ref-1].

The game continued Sierra's mission to "humanize" computer chess, a concept French reviewers praised as "un pari réussi" (a successful bet)[^ref-3]. Power Chess 2.0 featured the distinctive voice of Natacha LaFerriere as the Queen character, who provided post-game analysis and tutoring in both English and French versions[^ref-4]. The program incorporated adaptive difficulty technology, automatically adjusting its playing level during games to match the player's skill[^ref-5]. Despite being positioned as an updated release, some critics noted it was essentially "a simple update of Power Chess 98" with nothing significantly new[^ref-6].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Power Chess 2.0 offered players multiple viewpoint options including traditional top-down view and 3D perspective[^ref-1]. The game was controlled entirely via mouse, providing an accessible interface for chess players of all skill levels[^ref-1]. Players could choose from a large array of boards and visual options to customize their playing experience[^ref-8].

### Structure and Progression

The game featured single-player mode against AI opponents, hot-seat multiplayer for local two-player games, and Internet play for online competition[^ref-9]. The AI system was designed to learn and adapt to player strategies over time[^ref-8]. One of the game's most distinctive features was its post-game analysis system, where "a female voice, the Queen, walks the player through the game, pointing out and explaining where the player could have played better"[^ref-5].

### AI Personalities and Historical Matches

Power Chess 2.0 included AI personalities designed to mimic the playing styles of famous chess masters. Players could compete against computer representations of Gary Kasparov, Bobby Fischer, Judit Polgar, and Anatoly Karpov[^ref-1]. The game also featured an archive of over 150 famous chess matches, including the historic 1996 game between Kasparov and Deep Blue[^ref-1][^ref-8]. The Deep Blue versus Kasparov matches from the archives provided educational value for players studying championship-level play[^ref-3].

### Tutorial System

The voice tutorial feature, performed by Natacha LaFerriere, was praised by users who found her voice "lovely" and the program "actually a good tutor"[^ref-4]. The game also included the full book of Nimzowitsch's "My System," providing comprehensive chess education for aspiring players[^ref-6]. The AI could be customized and configured to improve at the player's skill rate, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced players[^ref-1].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Power Chess 2.0 received mixed reviews upon release. Génération 4 magazine awarded the game 3 out of 6 (50%) in January 1999[^ref-9]. PC Player gave a more favorable assessment with a score of 68 out of 100 in March 1999[^ref-9]. The MobyGames aggregate score sits at 67%[^ref-1].

The original Power Chess received significantly better reception, winning the "Traditional Game of the Year" award from Computer Games Strategy Plus in 1996[^ref-5]. PC Joker gave Power Chess (1996) its highest rating in March 1997[^ref-5], and the French magazine Joystick awarded it the "Mégastar" rating[^ref-3].

### Modern Assessment

Contemporary users and chess enthusiasts have provided mixed assessments of the Power Chess series. Some users on chess forums have praised the tutoring aspects, while others have been more critical. One prominent forum member, Sean Evans, bluntly stated "Power Chess is full of bugs, don't bother with it!"[^ref-10]. The compatibility issues with modern operating systems have significantly impacted the game's accessibility, with users reporting challenges running the software on Windows 7, Windows 10, and Windows 11[^ref-4][^ref-6].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** 67% (combined reviews)[^ref-1]
- **Génération 4:** 3/6 (50%)[^ref-9]
- **PC Player:** 68/100[^ref-9]
- **VGTimes User Rating:** 5.5/10[^ref-11]

## Development

### Origins

The Power Chess series originated with Sierra On-Line's effort to create an accessible yet powerful chess program for home computers. The original Power Chess was released on September 30, 1996 for Windows 95[^ref-5]. Sierra chose to license the WChess engine created by David Kittinger, which had an impressive pedigree in competitive computer chess[^ref-7]. The WChess engine won 5 of 6 matches against American chess grandmasters in 1994 and competed against IBM's Deep Blue in the 1995 World Computer Championship[^ref-3][^ref-5].

### Production

Power Chess 2.0 was developed by Sierra On-Line with the chess engine work attributed to David Kittinger and development support from Headgate Studios[^ref-6]. The game was released during a tumultuous period for Sierra, which underwent major corporate reorganization in 1999, shutting down several development studios[^ref-6]. This corporate instability may have contributed to the limited scope of improvements in the 2.0 version, which critics noted was "a simple update of Power Chess 98"[^ref-6].

**Development Credits:**[^ref-7][^ref-6]
- **Chess Engine:** David Kittinger (WChess)
- **Development:** [[Headgate Studios]]
- **Publisher:** Sierra On-Line

### Technical Achievements

The WChess engine powering Power Chess 2.0 represented significant achievement in computer chess programming. The engine's competitive performance against grandmasters and other computer programs demonstrated its strength[^ref-3]. The adaptive difficulty system was particularly innovative for its time, allowing the program to "adjust its level during the game trying to match that of the player"[^ref-5].

### Technical Issues

Power Chess 2.0 has significant compatibility problems with modern operating systems. Users report being unable to run the game on Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 10, and Windows 11 without special measures[^ref-4][^ref-12]. The error message "impossible de démarrer le moteur d'échecs" (unable to start the chess engine) is commonly encountered when attempting to run the game on newer systems[^ref-12].

The recommended workaround involves using virtualization software. Forum users suggest "télécharge virtual pc et tu install ensuite tu install ton windows 98 sur ta machine virtuel" (download virtual PC and install Windows 98 on your virtual machine)[^ref-12]. The game can reportedly run in VirtualBox with Windows 98 emulation[^ref-4]. Some users have noted that a special patch exists for running the game on newer Windows versions, though availability is limited[^ref-4].

The game was described as "buggy" even on its native Windows 98 platform, with reports indicating it worked best on Windows 95[^ref-6].

### Version History

| Version | Date | Platform | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| Power Chess | September 30, 1996 | Windows 95 | Initial release[^ref-5] |
| Power Chess 98 | 1997 | Windows 95/98 | Updated version[^ref-5] |
| Power Chess 2.0 | 1999 | Windows | Final release, also called Power Chess 99[^ref-1][^ref-6] |

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- The WChess engine competed against IBM's Deep Blue in the 1995 World Computer Championship[^ref-5]
- The game includes the historic Deep Blue vs. Kasparov match from 1996 in its archives[^ref-1]
- Power Chess was included in Sierra's Complete Chess compilation released in 1998[^ref-5]
- The game supports PGN file import/export for sharing games with other chess software[^ref-3]
- The full text of Nimzowitsch's classic chess instruction book "My System" was included with the game[^ref-6]

## Voice Cast

| Character | Voice Actor |
|-----------|-------------|
| Queen (English/French) | Natacha LaFerriere[^ref-4][^ref-5] |

The Queen character serves as the game's narrator and tutor, providing post-game analysis and instruction to help players improve their chess skills[^ref-5].

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

The original Power Chess was commercially successful enough to warrant two sequels. The 1996 release won the Traditional Game of the Year award from Computer Games Strategy Plus[^ref-5]. However, the series was discontinued after Sierra's acquisition, attributed to the existing saturated chess game market[^ref-3].

### Collections

Power Chess was included in Sierra's Complete Chess compilation released in 1998, which bundled multiple Sierra chess games together[^ref-5].

### Critical Perspective

Power Chess 2.0 represents the final entry in Sierra's attempt to make chess accessible and engaging for casual computer users. While the series began with genuine innovation—adaptive AI, voiced tutorial features, and historical match archives—by 1999 the improvements had stagnated. The game arrived during a difficult period for Sierra, and the corporate turmoil may have limited development resources[^ref-6].

The series is perhaps best remembered for its educational features rather than its competitive chess engine. The voiced Queen character, performed by Natacha LaFerriere, remains fondly recalled by users who appreciate both her pleasant delivery and the genuine instructional value of the post-game analysis[^ref-4]. In the modern era, the game's legacy is unfortunately overshadowed by severe compatibility issues that make it nearly impossible to run on contemporary systems without virtualization[^ref-4][^ref-6].
