# Return to Krondor

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

Return to Krondor is a fantasy role-playing game released in November 1998, serving as the direct sequel to the critically acclaimed Betrayal at Krondor (1993)[^ref-1]. Set in Raymond E. Feist's fictional world of Midkemia, the game follows Squire James—formerly known as Jimmy the Hand—as he leads a party of heroes on a quest to recover the Tear of the Gods, a sacred artifact of the Ishapian Church that has been lost to the depths of the Bitter Sea[^ref-2]. The game features pre-rendered backgrounds with changing camera angles, 3D character models, and a turn-based tactical combat system that critics praised as featuring "some of the juiciest turn-based battles ever to grace a role-playing game"[^ref-3].

Developed by PyroTechnix using their proprietary True3D engine, Return to Krondor went through a troubled development history that saw the project pass between multiple companies before finally reaching completion[^ref-1]. The game represents Sierra's return to the Krondor franchise after losing and then regaining the rights to Feist's novels[^ref-4]. While the game was designed to be "Book 1: Harbinger of the Shadows"—the first in a planned series—Sierra ultimately discontinued the franchise, leaving the storyline uncontinued in game form[^ref-5].

Despite receiving mixed reviews due to its short length and linear structure compared to its predecessor, Return to Krondor earned nominations for multiple awards including Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences PC Role Playing Game of the Year and Computer Gaming World Best RPG[^ref-1]. The game has maintained a devoted following, with fans praising its excellent story, atmosphere-building soundtrack, and engaging combat system[^ref-6].

## Story Summary

The story revolves around the disappearance of the Ishapian Church's most sacred relic, the Tear of the Gods[^ref-2]. A band of ruthless pirates—in the employ of Sidi, a shadowy, half-mad sorcerer—attempt to seize the Tear from the Ishapian treasure ship. In the process, they accidentally sink the vessel, sending the powerful artifact to the bottom of the Bitter Sea[^ref-7]. The Tear possesses unimaginable holy power, and its loss threatens catastrophic consequences for the realm of Midkemia.

Squire James of Krondor, a reformed thief who has risen to become one of Prince Arutha's most trusted agents, is tasked with investigating the disappearance[^ref-8]. He is joined by Jazhara, a Keshian sorceress making her first appearance in the Krondor universe; William ConDoin, a Krondorian guardsman; Brother Solon, an Ishapian warrior priest; and Kendaric, a mage from the Wrecker's Guild[^ref-9]. Together, this unlikely band must track down Bear, a madman seeking the relic for his own sinister purposes, while contending with the machinations of the necromancer Sidi who serves a mysterious "Dark One"[^ref-10].

The quest takes the party from the streets and sewers of Krondor through various dangerous locations as they work to raise the sunken ship and retrieve the Tear before it falls into the wrong hands[^ref-11]. The narrative unfolds across eleven chapters in a book-like structure, with the story narrated in third-person perspective[^ref-1]. Players face off against assassins, undead, vampires, goblins, and demons as they unravel a conspiracy that threatens the very foundations of the kingdom[^ref-12]. Raymond E. Feist wrote the story directly for the game, and he later adapted it into a full novel entitled "Krondor: Tear of the Gods"[^ref-1].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Return to Krondor is primarily a point-and-click game, representing a significant departure from the first-person exploration of its predecessor[^ref-13]. The game uses a third-person perspective with pre-rendered backgrounds and changing camera angles for exploration, similar to the approach used in Alone in the Dark[^ref-14]. Navigation can be somewhat tricky as the view changes to different perspectives when reaching certain points[^ref-15]. Players can change camera perspectives using the bracket keys on English keyboards or ß and ´ on German keyboards[^ref-16].

### Structure and Progression

The game is divided into eleven plot-twisting chapters that unfold in a linear, book-like fashion[^ref-17]. Compared to Betrayal at Krondor, the game is less heavy on exploration, featuring smaller and more confined areas[^ref-18]. Much of the game takes place within the city of Krondor, which is divided into distinct districts[^ref-18]. Unlike its predecessor, players cannot physically explore an overworld map[^ref-18].

- **Prologue:** Introduction and initial investigation
- **Chapters 1-2:** Time does not pass at all; William the knight is present[^ref-19]
- **Chapter 2 End:** William leaves the party permanently[^ref-19]
- **Chapter 3:** Final opportunity to use gold in Krondor before the party leaves permanently[^ref-19]
- **Chapters 4-10:** Main quest progression through various locations
- **Chapter 11:** Climactic conclusion

The game offers three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) and three game focus options (Fighter, Balanced, Mage) that affect the balance between combat and magic abilities[^ref-13].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The game features several distinctive gameplay systems. Combat is turn-based and tactical, with manual character movement on a combat grid[^ref-18]. The system includes a unique "fate" mechanic and supports six different paths of magic with a total of 60 adaptable spells[^ref-17][^ref-20].

The alchemy system allows players to brew potions, though only mages can participate in this activity[^ref-15]. One walkthrough author noted that they "found alchemy a worthless skill to pursue"[^ref-19]. The lockpicking minigame is detailed, featuring tool selection and careful manipulation[^ref-18].

Character development uses a leveling system with manual skill point allocation[^ref-18]. Skills improve through use and direct point investment, and characters have specific skill development recommendations. The game features over 30 locks, traps, and puzzles to overcome[^ref-17].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Return to Krondor received mixed reviews upon release, with critics generally praising its story and combat system while criticizing its short length and linear structure.

GameSpot awarded the game 7.9/10, with reviewer Desslock noting that "Return to Krondor may not be an epic sequel to Betrayal at Krondor, but its excellent graphics and immersive plot make it an enjoyable story-driven game"[^ref-21]. PC Gamer US gave it 80%, calling it "a fun, quick RPG with a good story"[^ref-1]. Computer Games Strategy Plus was highly enthusiastic, with John Altman calling it "very engaging and a stunning return to form for the Krondor series" featuring "some of the juiciest turn-based battles ever to grace a role-playing game"[^ref-3].

IGN scored the game 7.4/10, with Steve Butts stating that "Return to Krondor really delivers"[^ref-20]. Game Informer awarded 8.25/10[^ref-1]. CNET Gamecenter gave it 8/10, with Arinn Dembo describing it as "one of the most complex role-playing games of the year"[^ref-22].

However, Computer Gaming World's Petra Schlunk was highly critical, calling the game "completely underdeveloped and a lightweight RPG" that was "too short; shamefully unfinished in terms of its story; and far too linear"[^ref-23]. PC Accelerator gave only 5/10[^ref-1]. Next Generation scored it 3/5, noting "The game is well-made, and the plot will keep gamers on the edge of their seats. It's just too bad they won't stay there very long"[^ref-1].

AllGame's Joshua Roberts praised the visuals, stating "It's easily one of the most visually impressive computer RPGs I've ever seen," but criticized the voice acting: "You'll never find less inspired voice acting"[^ref-24].

### Modern Assessment

Modern assessments of Return to Krondor remain divided. The game holds a 71.67% aggregate score on GameRankings based on 21 reviews[^ref-25]. MobyGames lists a critics average of 74%[^ref-5]. GOG.com users rate it 3.9/5[^ref-2], while Steam reviews show a "Mixed" rating with 63% positive from 95 reviews[^ref-7].

Some retrospective voices are more enthusiastic. One MobyGames user declared that "1998 was quite a year for the CRPG... Baldur's Gate as well as Return To Krondor were released. These two epic CRPGs would usher in a new age of CRPG goodness. Of those two aforementioned games, RTK was by far the better"[^ref-5]. Another simply called it "One of the best CRPGs ever made"[^ref-5].

The CRPG Addict blog described it as "A well-written, prose-heavy sequel to Raymond Feist's Riftwar Saga," noting that "Very few things about it are individually unique, but most things about it are at least rare, and in combination they make the game unique"[^ref-26].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **GameRankings:** 71.67% (21 reviews)[^ref-25]
- **MobyGames:** 74% (critics average)[^ref-5]
- **IMDB:** 7.2/10 (36 ratings)[^ref-27]
- **GOG.com:** 3.9/5[^ref-2]
- **Steam:** 63% positive (95 reviews)[^ref-7]

## Development

### Origins

The development of Return to Krondor has its roots in the tremendous success of Betrayal at Krondor, released in 1993 and widely considered one of the best PC RPGs ever made[^ref-28]. The original development team at Dynamix, led by designers John Cutter and Neal Hallford, had intended to create a sequel[^ref-29]. However, when Dynamix restructured and closed their role-playing department in 1994, the planned sequel—tentatively called "Thief of Dreams"—was cancelled[^ref-1][^ref-10].

The rights to create Midkemia games had originally been secured through a licensing deal with Raymond E. Feist. Feist was protective of his intellectual property; when approached about contributing directly to game development, he stated that his time was money and noted flatly, "you couldn't afford me"[^ref-30]. The licensing agreement had been expensive, potentially "the most expensive literary game license at the time"[^ref-30].

After Dynamix abandoned the sequel, 7th Level acquired the rights and began production in 1995[^ref-31]. Neal Hallford, one of the original Betrayal at Krondor designers, began consulting for 7th Level on the design and story of Return to Krondor in 1994[^ref-32].

### Production

Development of Return to Krondor proved troubled and prolonged. 7th Level developed the game basics, produced screen backgrounds, and added character voices, but turned to their Cincinnati-based subsidiary PyroTechnix for the technical aspects[^ref-1]. PyroTechnix brought their True3D engine to the project, the same technology that Sony had licensed for EverQuest[^ref-33].

As 7th Level faced financial difficulties and worked to exit the game publishing business, they sold PyroTechnix to Sierra On-Line on December 8, 1997, for $1.2 million[^ref-34]. This sale brought Return to Krondor back to Sierra—the original publishers of Betrayal at Krondor. Scott Lynch, Senior Vice President of Sierra, stated: "PyroTechnix is an innovative and talented team that complements Sierra's roster of industry-leading game developers and 'Return to Krondor' will be a key product in our 1998 line-up"[^ref-34]. He added, "As the original developers of 'Betrayal at Krondor' we're thrilled to welcome Raymond Feist and the 'Krondor' series back to the Sierra family"[^ref-34].

The game was completed by PyroTechnix under Sierra's direction and released in November 1998—five years after the announcement of a sequel to Betrayal at Krondor[^ref-35]. GamePro noted that the game "took a long detour" in its development[^ref-35].

**Development Credits:**[^ref-5]
- **Designers:** Steve Abrams, Craig Bolin, Raymond E. Feist, Brian Kraack, Jeff Mills, Erick Wujcik
- **Lead Designers:** Andy Ashcraft, Jeryd Pojawa
- **Additional Designers:** Sinjin Bain, Chuck Wiggins
- **Story Consultant:** Neal Hallford[^ref-32]

### Technical Achievements

Return to Krondor utilized PyroTechnix's proprietary True3D engine, which supported both Direct3D and software rendering modes[^ref-21]. The game featured over 180 motion-captured 3D characters, more than 200 rendered locations, and real-time lighting and special effects that were new to RPGs at the time[^ref-17][^ref-8].

The graphics employed pre-rendered 2D backgrounds—over 2,500 attractive backdrops edited in Adobe Photoshop—combined with 3D character models[^ref-35][^ref-15]. Colin E. Sweeney noted that the backgrounds were "pre-rendered and edited in Adobe PhotoShop"[^ref-15]. The 16-bit color graphics were considered "pretty stunning" for the time[^ref-28].

**Resolution:** 640x480 (locked)[^ref-37]
**Graphics API:** DirectX 5, Direct3D 5[^ref-16]

### Cut Content

The most significant cut content relates to planned sequels. Return to Krondor was subtitled "Book 1: Harbinger of the Shadows" because it was designed as the first part in a planned series of games[^ref-5]. However, Sierra dropped the Krondor franchise after release, and the storyline was never continued in game form[^ref-5].

Additionally, the original sequel to Betrayal at Krondor—called "Thief of Dreams"—was developed by the creators at Dynamix but never completed when the RPG department was closed in 1994[^ref-10][^ref-1].

A PlayStation port was discussed but never materialized. When asked about the possibility, Raymond Feist responded: "Not at this time. Probably not any time in the future. The deals between game companies and platform companies tend to fluctuate at times. Sony was very tight with Pyrotechnix before the Sierra buyout. Now they are not"[^ref-33].

### Version History

| Version | Date | Platform | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| 1.0 | November 30, 1998 | Windows | Initial release[^ref-1] |
| 1.0.0.6 | 1998 | Windows | Patch fixing save problems, DirectSound workarounds, crash fixes[^ref-38] |
| GOG.com | March 4, 2010 | Windows | Updated for modern Windows compatibility[^ref-1] |
| Steam | December 15, 2016 | Windows | Digital distribution release[^ref-39] |

### Technical Issues

The game has experienced various technical issues, particularly on modern systems:

- Save problem with book options (fixed in patch 1.0.0.6)[^ref-38]
- DirectSound compatibility issues[^ref-38]
- Intermittent crashes to Windows[^ref-38]
- Access Violation errors on modern Windows[^ref-40]
- Missing character textures[^ref-40]
- Blurry text rendering due to Windows font scaling in GOG version[^ref-16]
- Heavy graphical errors on Intel integrated GPUs[^ref-16]
- Game crashes when conversation starts if install path contains a full stop[^ref-16]
- Compatibility challenges with Windows 10/11[^ref-40]

Modern players have found success using dgVoodoo wrapper, adjusting Data Execution Prevention settings, or using WineD3D[^ref-40]. One forum user noted: "It's a 1998 game which can use a DX5 implementation, but for this particular program software rendering works best"[^ref-37].

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- **Cheat Code:** Players can enable a powerful mage cheat by editing RTKRONDOR.INI, setting Console=1, pressing ALT-C on the final navigation screen, and typing "PYROMANIA"—this enables all mage spells and allows casting without cost[^ref-41]
- **Character Canon:** Jazhara made her first appearance in this game and was later incorporated into the official Midkemia canon[^ref-10]
- **Novelization:** Raymond E. Feist adapted the game's story into the novel "Krondor: Tear of the Gods," and in 2013 wrapped up related storylines with "Jimmy and the Crawler"[^ref-10]
- **Midkemia Origins:** The name "Midkemia" was coined by Conan LaMont during tabletop RPG sessions; he "said he had no idea what it meant—he just liked the sound"[^ref-42]

## Voice Cast

| Character | Voice Actor |
|-----------|-------------|
| James | Christopher Daniel Barnes[^ref-27] |
| Lucky Pete | Earl Boen[^ref-27] |
| Jamie Cronin | John Carroll Lynch[^ref-27] |
| Various | Jennifer Hale[^ref-5] |
| Various | Nick Jameson[^ref-5] |
| Various | Tom Kane[^ref-27] |
| Various | Edita Brychta[^ref-27] |
| Various | Gary Stevens[^ref-5] |

Opinions on the voice acting varied dramatically. Colin E. Sweeney stated "Incredibly, the voice acting is top notch and very well done"[^ref-15], while Joshua Roberts of AllGame countered "You'll never find less inspired voice acting"[^ref-24]. The Abandonware DOS review humorously noted players would "face off against assassins, undead, and the greatest enemy of all: bad voice acting"[^ref-12].

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Return to Krondor was reported to be "selling well" as of December 1998[^ref-1]. By July 2000, the game ranked #11 on the PC Data sales chart at a price of $18, published under Havas Interactive[^ref-43]. The game was nominated for several awards including Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences PC Role Playing Game of the Year, Computer Gaming World Best RPG, CNET Gamecenter Best RPG of 1998, and GameSpot Role-playing Game of the Year[^ref-1].

### Collections

The game was released in several packaged editions:
- PC CD-ROM in large flip-top box with flap (US)[^ref-44]
- PC CD-ROM in large flip-top box with flap (EU English)[^ref-44]
- PC CD-ROM in large flip-top box with flap (EU German, titled "Raymond E. Feist's Rückkehr nach Krondor")[^ref-44][^ref-45]
- Sierra Originals budget release (EU English)[^ref-44]
- Digital download via GOG.com (2010)[^ref-44]
- Digital download via Steam (2016)[^ref-39]

The original CD release included demos for Caesar III, Hoyle Board Games 2, and Lords of Magic Special Edition[^ref-44].

### Fan Projects

The game has maintained a devoted following with fan-created resources:
- Multiple detailed walkthroughs on GameFAQs[^ref-45]
- Speedrunning community with routing guides[^ref-46]
- Fan websites dedicated to documenting "all possible quests, plots, twists, and neat little quirks"[^ref-47]

One devoted fan reported playing their "favourite cRPG 'Return to Krondor' for fifth or sixth time," remaining "still enthralled with its story and music"[^ref-48]. Raymond Feist himself passed along that composer Chuck Mitchell "still has copies of the sound track and was glad to hear people still like them"[^ref-48].

### Related Publications

- **Return to Krondor: Prima's Official Strategy Guide:** Written by Prima Games, 272 pages, published December 9, 1998[^ref-9]
- **Game Manual:** Official documentation included with the game[^ref-13]
- **Krondor: Tear of the Gods:** Novelization by Raymond E. Feist based on the game's story[^ref-1]
- **Jimmy and the Crawler:** 2013 novel by Raymond E. Feist continuing related storylines[^ref-10]

### Critical Perspective

Return to Krondor occupies an unusual position in RPG history. Released the same year as Baldur's Gate, it represented a different approach to the genre—more focused on story-driven, linear narrative than open-world exploration[^ref-5]. GamePro's Barry Brenesal captured this distinction perfectly: "Betrayal felt like a universe. Return feels like a beautifully visualized pencil-and-paper RPG"[^ref-35].

The game's troubled development history and abbreviated scope prevented it from reaching the heights of its predecessor. Computer Gaming World's review noted that "Return to Krondor has tremendous potential, a good combat system, a fair story (for what there is of one), and a definite fun factor. However, it is completely underdeveloped"[^ref-23]. Yet this criticism exists alongside genuine appreciation for what the game achieved—an engrossing story set in a beloved fantasy world with memorable characters and tactical combat.

The game's legacy is complicated by Sierra's decision to abandon the franchise. As one reviewer noted, "Return to Krondor was obviously made to be the first in a series of games"[^ref-50], and the subtitle "Book 1" remains a promise unfulfilled in game form. However, Raymond E. Feist's novelization and subsequent books ensured the story found completion in print, demonstrating the enduring appeal of the Midkemia setting across multiple media.

## See Also

Return to Krondor is the direct sequel to Betrayal at Krondor, taking place approximately one year after the events of that game[^ref-28]. The game features returning character James (Jimmy the Hand), now serving as Squire James of Krondor, having risen from his origins as a thief in the original game[^ref-11]. The setting remains the same fantasy world of Midkemia from Raymond E. Feist's Riftwar Saga novels.

Unlike Betrayal in Antara (1997)—a spiritual successor set in a different world—Return to Krondor continues the authentic Midkemia storyline[^ref-4]. The game was intended to launch a new series of Krondor games, but Sierra's discontinuation of the franchise meant no further game sequels were produced[^ref-5].
