# Betrayal at Krondor

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

Betrayal at Krondor is a groundbreaking role-playing game developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra On-Line, released on June 22, 1993 for MS-DOS.[^ref-1] Set in the fantasy world of Midkemia from Raymond E. Feist's bestselling Riftwar Saga novels, the game represented one of the most ambitious literary adaptations in gaming history, featuring an original story that would later become canonical to Feist's universe.[^ref-2] The game was revolutionary for its time, being among the first RPGs to offer a true 3D environment and one of the first games to use digitized images effectively in the context of a role-playing game.[^ref-3]

Designed to resemble an interactive novel, Betrayal at Krondor divided its narrative into nine distinct chapters, each with specific goals while allowing players considerable freedom in how those objectives were achieved.[^ref-4] The game employed Dynamix's 3Space engine, the same technology used in their acclaimed flight simulators Red Baron and Aces over Europe, adapted to create an immersive fantasy world spanning 224 million square feet of explorable terrain.[^ref-5] Contemporary reviewers praised it as "a fantasy role-playing game unlike any other" and "a new high-watermark in RPG design."[^ref-3]

The game achieved critical and commercial success, winning Computer Gaming World's Role-Playing Game of the Year award and sitting atop Entertainment Weekly's CD game best-seller list for six months.[^ref-6] Though initial sales on floppy disk were slow, the 1994 CD-ROM re-release transformed Betrayal at Krondor into a major hit, cementing its reputation as one of the greatest CRPGs ever created.[^ref-1]

## Story Summary

The story begins as Gorath, a moredhel (dark elf) renegade, is attacked by an assassin while attempting to warn the people of Krondor of an upcoming moredhel invasion led by the warlord Delekhan.[^ref-2] Gorath is rescued by Seigneur Locklear, a young knight serving Prince Arutha of Krondor, and the two encounter Owyn Beleforte, a young magician from Tiburn.[^ref-4] Together, the unlikely trio must journey to Krondor to deliver Gorath's warning about the impending threat to the Kingdom of the Isles.

The narrative unfolds across nine chapters that explore political intrigue, ancient magic, and the complex relationship between humans and the moredhel, who have been enemies for generations.[^ref-7] As players progress, they uncover a conspiracy involving the Nighthawks, an ancient guild of assassins who have plagued Midkemia for centuries and were purged from Krondor ten years prior by Prince Arutha after their involvement in the poisoning of Princess Anita.[^ref-8] The characters also encounter Lysle Rigger, Jimmy the Hand's long-lost twin brother, a character first introduced in this game who would later appear in Feist's novels.[^ref-1]

The story takes players across the realm of Midkemia, from the northern provinces of Yabon and LaMut to the city of Krondor itself, and eventually to the mystical elven realm of Elvandar and the magical academy of Timirianya.[^ref-9] Throughout their journey, players meet established characters from Feist's novels including Prince Arutha, James (formerly Jimmy the Hand), Pug the magician, and Duke Martin, while encountering new characters created specifically for the game.[^ref-6] The tale explores themes of redemption, loyalty, and the possibility of peace between ancient enemies, culminating in a confrontation that reveals the true scope of Delekhan's plans and the titular betrayal at the heart of the conspiracy.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Betrayal at Krondor employs what contemporary reviewers called "one of the easiest and most intuitive interfaces encountered, one that conveniently handles all aspects of the game, from trading to casting magic spells to combat."[^ref-1] The game presents exploration through a first-person 3D perspective while combat switches to an isometric tactical view with characters positioned on a grid system.[^ref-11] Players can control navigation using either keyboard or mouse, with the interface designed to feel like reading and interacting with a book.[^ref-12]

The game's book-like presentation extends throughout its design philosophy, with text windows styled to look like paper pages, chapter transitions marked with page numbers, and even the quick-save option labeled as a "bookmark."[^ref-13] This thematic consistency earned praise for its thoroughness: "This is the way you do a game with stylisation – you pull no punches and dedicate it completely to the theme."[^ref-13]

### Structure and Progression

The game is divided into nine chapters, each functioning like a section of a novel with specific narrative goals while allowing considerable freedom in exploration and approach:[^ref-4]

- **Chapter 1:** Journey to warn Prince Arutha, traveling from the northern provinces toward Krondor
- **Chapter 2:** Investigation and political maneuvering within the kingdom
- **Chapter 3:** Expanding exploration of the gameworld with multiple objectives
- **Chapter 4:** Prison break sequence involving character Owyn[^ref-14]
- **Chapter 5:** Continued investigation with house encounters
- **Chapter 6:** Magical trap challenges and powerful weapon acquisition[^ref-15]
- **Chapter 7:** Further political developments
- **Chapter 8:** Journey to Timirianya and encounter with Pug[^ref-16]
- **Chapter 9:** Final confrontation and resolution

Each chapter establishes boundaries on where players can travel, with new areas opening as the story progresses.[^ref-17] The design philosophy prioritized player agency within the narrative framework: "From a quick glance at the MAP it should be obvious that the most direct path towards Krondor is the one leading South from the starting point. It is quite possible to finish the game by choosing this route. However, you should bear in mind that you have access to many other areas in this Chapter."[^ref-18]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The game features a distinctive skill-based character development system that predated similar systems in later games like Morrowind by nearly a decade.[^ref-19] Skills improve only through direct use—using lockpicks increases lockpicking ability, wielding melee weapons improves combat proficiency—with diminishing returns at higher skill levels.[^ref-19] This replaced the traditional experience point and level-based progression of contemporary RPGs.

One of the most memorable gameplay elements are the moredhel wordlock chests, locked containers requiring players to solve riddle puzzles to discover the correct word combination.[^ref-4] These chests scattered throughout the world contain valuable items and equipment, and their riddles became a beloved feature among players. Combat operates on a turn-based tactical system where players position characters on a grid, described as "positioning his characters on a grid like a game of chess."[^ref-11]

The game notably lacks random encounters, with all enemy encounters placed deliberately at the beginning of each chapter.[^ref-20] This finite pool of combat encounters means players must manage resources carefully, as mistakes early in the game can potentially make later chapters unwinnable.[^ref-20] Players can rest to recover health and stamina, though resting outdoors only restores characters to 80% of their maximum.[^ref-19]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Betrayal at Krondor received widespread critical acclaim upon release, with reviewers praising its innovative approach to RPG design and narrative integration.

**Pelit magazine** awarded the game 94%, praising "the wonderful game system, lack of bugs, and the book-like atmosphere" and declaring "Krondor is as big a revolution in turn-based role playing games as the Underworlds were in 3D role playing games."[^ref-3]

**Computer Gaming World** named it "a fantasy role-playing game unlike any other" and "a new high-watermark in RPG design," specifically lauding the game's text as "the best I've seen in a fantasy CRPG" and calling it "a rare gem...and has set new standards for others to follow. For once, a game actually lives up to, even exceeds, its advance billing."[^ref-1]

**White Wolf Magazine #38** gave an excellent rating, with Jim Trunzo writing: "Betrayal at Krondor employs one of the easiest and most intuitive interfaces encountered, one that conveniently handles all aspects of the game, from trading to casting magic spells to combat. Graphics and sound are top-notch, character development is logical and fair, combat is beautifully animated, and I have yet to find anything about the game that I don't like. There simply isn't any facet of the game that isn't outstanding."[^ref-1]

**COMPUTE! Magazine** reviewer Scott A. May declared: "Fired by literary passion and uncommon intelligence, Betrayal at Krondor approaches a new level of realism and enjoyment for computer fantasy role-playing games" and noted it was "amazing that this game, Dynamix's first attempt at fantasy role-playing, towers above the genre."[^ref-5]

**Electronic Games** awarded an impressive 97% score in their June 1993 review by Ed Dille.[^ref-6]

**Dragon magazine #199** offered a more measured assessment, with Sandy Petersen giving 2 out of 5 stars while acknowledging the "well-rendered" visuals and "rather entertaining plot," though criticizing "dull maintenance activities."[^ref-3]

**Quandary** (1996) awarded 4.5 out of 5, calling it "no ordinary roleplaying game."[^ref-3]

### Modern Assessment

Betrayal at Krondor has maintained its reputation as a landmark RPG, frequently appearing on best-of lists decades after release. Modern critics continue to praise its narrative sophistication and innovative design choices.

The game has been described as "thoroughly unique, a welcome breath of bold originality in a genre usually content to rely on the tried and true."[^ref-20] One modern analysis noted: "Talent truly triumphs over everything else...No other RPG I know dedicated so much care and effort to balancing those two extremes - the freedom to go wherever you want and the dominance of a tight plot."[^ref-21]

**IGN** ranked Betrayal at Krondor #92 on their Top 100 RPGs list, with Chris Reed noting it was "surprisingly open-world for a game of its vintage" and advising players to "bring your reading glasses, because Krondor is dense with text, which should come as no surprise considering its literary origins."[^ref-22]

The game earned particular praise for its immersive qualities. One MobyGames reviewer wrote: "A gasp escaped my lips as I reluctantly quit the game. 'This is what immersion is all about', I muttered with grim satisfaction."[^ref-21] Another declared: "I'd count it among the four finest RPGs released so far, along with Ultima VII: The Black Gate, Baldur's Gate, and Final Fantasy IV."[^ref-23]

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** 84% critics score (16 reviews), 3.9/5 players (106 ratings)[^ref-24]
- **IMDB:** 8.5/10 (90 ratings)[^ref-25]
- **GOG.com:** 4.6/5 (90 reviews)[^ref-26]
- **Steam:** Very Positive (90% of 121 reviews)[^ref-27]
- **Game Rankings:** 88%[^ref-3]

## Development

### Origins

The development of Betrayal at Krondor began when John Cutter, a producer at Dynamix, discovered Raymond E. Feist's Riftwar novels. Cutter later recalled: "Here was a book filled with marvelous images of incredible worlds, and a real emphasis on character development, political intrigues, and military tactics and strategies."[^ref-12] He approached Feist at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June 1991, proposing to "design a game that felt like one of your books."[^ref-12]

When asked if he would write the game himself, Feist replied simply: "you couldn't afford me."[^ref-20] The license negotiations were significant—the Riftwar adaptation became "the most expensive literary license yet granted to a game developer" at the time.[^ref-20] The contract gave Dynamix rights to make Midkemia games until January 1, 1995.[^ref-20]

Dynamix CEO Jeff Tunnell originated the plan to license Feist's novels and green-lit the project after meeting with Cutter.[^ref-28] When designer Neal Hallford was brought aboard, having been recruited from New World Computing where he had worked on Might and Magic games, Tunnell simply stated: "If John's good with you, then it's all right by me."[^ref-28]

### Production

Development took approximately one year and seven months, with a core team of fourteen members working on the project.[^ref-29] The development ran "dramatically over time and over budget" according to later accounts.[^ref-20] The team operated out of Dynamix's offices in Eugene, Oregon, initially in the Atrium Building before relocating to Riverfront Research Park during development.[^ref-30]

Contrary to popular belief, Raymond E. Feist did not write the game's plot or dialogue. Feist was busy writing The King's Buccaneer during the game's production, so the story, text, and new characters were created entirely by designers Neal Hallford and John Cutter.[^ref-1] Feist had editorial final say, but most of what Hallford and Cutter created was left intact.[^ref-1] The development team's guiding question was: "What if the player was going to act as a character in a new book, one that takes place after A Darkness at Sethanon?"[^ref-12]

The demanding development schedule took a serious toll on the team. Neal Hallford later recalled that the project was "one of the best weeks of my life" while also remembering collapsing at the office from overwork.[^ref-20] A doctor told him: "You're not going back to work for a week. Get some rest and eat something proper. No pizza. No soft drinks. It's either this or next time you leave work it'll be in a hearse."[^ref-20]

**Development Credits:**[^ref-24]

- **Producer/Designer:** John Cutter
- **Lead Writer/Designer:** Neal Hallford
- **Lead Programmer:** Nels Bruckner[^ref-28]
- **Composer:** Jan Paul Moorhead[^ref-31]
- **Cover Art:** D. Brent Burkett, Roger Smith[^ref-31]

The game featured 153 credited personnel—109 developers and 44 people in thanks credits.[^ref-24]

### Technical Achievements

Betrayal at Krondor utilized Dynamix's 3Space engine, the same technology powering their flight simulators Red Baron and Aces over Europe.[^ref-5] Neal Hallford described seeing the engine for the first time: "It was a true 3D engine. Before Castle Wolfenstein, before Doom, this was the most immersive simulation of world exploration I'd yet seen."[^ref-28] Andy Ashcraft, who later worked on Return to Krondor, explained: "Dynamix was a flight sim company, and their engine [for Betrayal at Krondor] was a flight sim engine that had been tweaked into an RPG."[^ref-32]

The game featured more than 2,500 frames of rotoscoped animation and created a world of 224 million square feet of explorable terrain.[^ref-5] Character portraits and animations used digitized photographs of real people, though this choice drew mixed reactions—the CRPG Addict blogger later quipped: "Were the wigs really necessary? I know we're talking about game developers here, but could their own hair have been that bad?"[^ref-33]

### Cut Content

The original plan was to adapt Feist's novel Silverthorn, but the project evolved into an original story set in the Riftwar universe.[^ref-30] A planned sequel titled "Thief of Dreams" was developed by Dynamix but canceled in 1994 after the initial slow sales of Krondor on floppy disk.[^ref-32]

### Technical Issues

The official patch 1.02 addressed several issues from the original releases:[^ref-15]
- Problem which could result in improper data saved within saved game files (Version 1.0 only)
- The "Final Rest" lockup—casting the Final Rest spell on a Black Slayer could cause the game to hang if there was a dead body in the same combat cell
- Occasional problems getting past the magical trap in Chapter Six
- Under unusual circumstances, a very powerful sword available only in Chapter Six could add to an opponent's health/stamina rather than reduce it
- Items placed in moredhel lock chests could be "stolen"

Additional known issues included:[^ref-23]
- Final Rest spell bug when cast on dead Nighthawk/Black Slayer with another character on same tile causes game freeze
- Camera rotation taking twice as long as it should
- Perspective issues making it difficult to access overlapping objects
- Building freeze in Chapter 4 (resolved by turning off sound)[^ref-36]
- Chapter 5 houses freezing game when clicked (resolved by turning off sound)[^ref-36]

Modern compatibility issues with the CD version include short music tracks that don't loop properly, causing combat sequences to become silent, and tracks that don't dynamically fade out causing sudden scene transitions.[^ref-35]

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

The game includes a hidden cheat menu accessible through specific inputs, featuring dialogue such as: "Why, do we attempt to take the cheater's path? Certainly there are other paths to take..." and "We should be cautious not to abuse this power. On the other hand, perhaps we are in a situation where we could use it."[^ref-37]

A glitch (or possibly intended hidden feature) allows players to make certain combinations of two moves in a single turn using mouse and keyboard combinations. Computer opponents also appear to use this technique in some instances.[^ref-1]

Players discovered an exploit allowing unlimited money generation, which walkthrough author James David Allan documented, noting: "I wonder if this is a bug, or a deviously concealed loophole."[^ref-18]

Fan guide author orpheus famously suggested: "NOTE: Michael Dorn should portray Gorath in a Betrayal At Krondor movie."[^ref-38]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

The game's commercial journey was initially troubled. Sales of the original 3½" floppy disk release were slow, leading Sierra to sell the Riftwar rights back to Raymond Feist.[^ref-1] However, the game's fortunes changed dramatically with positive reviews and word of mouth. When re-released on CD-ROM in early 1994 with enhanced features, "the game suddenly became a huge hit."[^ref-24]

According to Raymond E. Feist himself: "Betrayal at Krondor won awards, sat atop the Entertainment Weekly CD game best-seller list for six months, and is considered by many to be the best computer fantasy role-playing game ever created."[^ref-6] The CD-ROM version "featured lovely soundtrack and enhanced graphics" that helped drive renewed interest.[^ref-20]

### Awards

The game accumulated numerous accolades:[^ref-1][^ref-24][^ref-6]

- **Computer Gaming World Role-Playing Game of the Year** (June 1994)
- **Computer Gaming World Game of the Year** (1993)
- **Computer Games Strategy Plus Best RPG and Game of the Year** (1993)
- **Compute Magazine Best Fantasy Role-playing/Adventure Game of the Year**
- **Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame** (inducted 2001)
- **Computer Gaming World #43 on 150 Best Games of All Time** (November 1996)
- **GameStar (Germany) #76 in 100 Most Important PC Games of the Nineties** (December 1999)
- **PC Gamer #31 Best Computer Game Ever** (1994)
- **PC Gamer #44 Best Computer Game Ever** (1998)
- **PC Gamer Top 50 Computer Games of All Time** (1997)

### Collections

The game has appeared in several compilations:
- **Betrayal Collection** (Steam, December 15, 2016) – Bundled with Betrayal in Antara[^ref-27]
- **GOG.com bundle** – Packaged with Betrayal in Antara[^ref-26]

### Fan Projects

Neal Hallford has discussed fan efforts to remaster the game using modern engines like Amazon Lumberyard, while emphasizing: "This is a not-for-profit, self-educational project. I will never sell anything with the Krondor name on it, or with any of the content based in the Midkemia universe unless otherwise given express permission / license from Raymond E. Feist and Midkemia Press."[^ref-29]

A complete text compilation of all game dialogue and narrative was compiled by Eysteinn Bjornsson and hosted at www.hi.is/~eybjorn/krondor/textweb.html, preserving the game's extensive written content.[^ref-38]

### Related Publications

- **Betrayal at Krondor Manual:** 88 pages across 17 chapters, featuring an introduction by Raymond E. Feist and designer notes by John Cutter[^ref-39]
- **Krondor: The Betrayal** by Raymond E. Feist (HarperCollins, October 1999) – Novel adaptation that made the game's story canonical to the Riftwar universe[^ref-1]

### Critical Perspective

Betrayal at Krondor occupies a unique position in RPG history as a game that successfully bridged literary fiction and interactive entertainment. The developers at BioWare cited it as a direct influence on Baldur's Gate, demonstrating its lasting impact on the genre.[^ref-21] Its approach to narrative—treating the game as an interactive novel with meaningful player agency within a crafted story—influenced how developers approached story-driven RPGs for decades afterward.

The game was remarkable for being Dynamix's first and only RPG. A company known for flight simulators created what many consider one of the finest RPGs ever made, prompting one reviewer to note: "Talent truly triumphs over everything else."[^ref-21] The designers' willingness to break established RPG conventions—no random encounters, use-based skill improvement, chapter-based storytelling—created something distinctive that stood apart from both Western and Japanese RPG traditions of the era.

Perhaps most significantly, Betrayal at Krondor demonstrated that licensed games could exceed their source material rather than merely capitalize on it. When Feist first saw the finished product at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1993, he reflected: "It was a revelation. It was my world, but it wasn't. These were my characters, but they weren't."[^ref-6] His decision to novelize the game's story, making it canonical to his literary universe, remains one of the most notable examples of a game influencing its source franchise rather than the reverse.

## Related Games

Betrayal at Krondor spawned both official and unofficial successors:

- **Betrayal in Antara** (1997) – Developed by Sierra without the Feist license, using original characters in a new setting[^ref-26]
- **Return to Krondor** (1998) – Official sequel developed by PyroTechnix/7th Level and published by Sierra Studios, later novelized by Feist as Krondor: Tear of the Gods[^ref-32]
