# Heart of China

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

Heart of China is a 1991 adventure game developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra On-Line, representing one of the studio's most ambitious attempts at creating an "interactive movie" experience[^ref-3]. Set against the breathtaking splendor of 1930s Asia, the game follows former World War I fighter pilot Jake "Lucky" Masters on a globe-spanning adventure to rescue a kidnapped nurse from a ruthless Chinese warlord[^ref-2]. The game was designed by [[Jeff Tunnell]], who envisioned it as an immersive cinematic experience that would eliminate the frustration factor commonly associated with adventure gaming[^ref-3].

The game is notable for its innovative visual presentation, utilizing a mixture of digitized photos of live actors superimposed on beautifully hand-painted backgrounds—a technique that made it "perhaps one of the most graphically stunning PC games of the era"[^ref-4]. Inspired by adventure films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark and Romancing the Stone, Heart of China captures the spirit of 1930s pulp adventure serials while incorporating multiple solution paths, branching narratives, and optional arcade sequences that can be skipped by players who prefer pure adventure gameplay[^ref-5]. The game represents Dynamix's "excellent farewell to the adventure genre" before the studio shifted focus to simulation and strategy games[^ref-6].

## Story Summary

In 1930s Hong Kong, struggling former World War I fighter pilot Jake "Lucky" Masters is recruited by wealthy American businessman E.A. Lomax for a dangerous mission[^ref-9]. Kate Lomax, the daughter of this ruthless land baron, has been abducted by a Chinese warlord named Li Deng near Chengdu, where she was volunteering as a nurse[^ref-2]. Lomax offers Masters a $200,000 reward—with $20,000 deducted for each day Kate remains absent—to venture into the dangerous Chinese interior and rescue his daughter[^ref-4].

Masters' journey takes him from the streets of Hong Kong to the warlord's fortress in Chengdu, where he must infiltrate Li Deng's compound and extract Kate[^ref-10]. Along the way, he encounters Chi, a mysterious ninja who becomes an invaluable ally in the rescue mission[^ref-11]. The adventure spans multiple continents as the trio makes their desperate escape, traveling through Kathmandu, Istanbul, and aboard the Orient Express as they flee their pursuers across an entire continent[^ref-12].

Throughout the journey, players' actions shape the relationships between the characters, tracked by a "Romance Meter" that affects the game's outcome[^ref-13]. The narrative concludes with multiple possible endings depending on the choices made throughout the adventure—ranging from marriage to ending up in a ditch[^ref-11]. In one ending, the game concludes with the characters masquerading as room service to surprise Kate, with all three sipping champagne in a Parisian five-star hotel room[^ref-14].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Heart of China employs a first-person point-and-click interface similar to that used in Rise of the Dragon, Dynamix's earlier adventure title[^ref-15]. The game utilizes a "VCR-style" menu interface that streamlines player interaction with the game world[^ref-6]. As [[Jeff Tunnell]] explained during development: "With our 'point-and-click' interaction system, our goal was to eliminate the frustration factor from adventure gaming, so that nothing interferes with the experience of the game"[^ref-3].

The interface supports both keyboard and mouse input, with the mouse being the recommended control method for optimal gameplay experience[^ref-16]. Players interact with the environment by clicking on objects and characters, selecting from contextual action menus to examine, take, use, or talk to elements within each scene[^ref-15].

### Structure and Progression

One of the most unique elements of Heart of China is the multiple ways in which players can proceed through gameplay[^ref-12]. The game allows players to control three different characters—Jake "Lucky" Masters, Chi, and Kate Lomax—switching between them at various points to solve puzzles and advance the story[^ref-11]. This character-switching mechanic adds depth to puzzle solutions and allows for multiple approaches to challenges.

The adventure spans several distinct locations across Asia and Europe:

- **Hong Kong:** The starting point where Masters accepts the mission and prepares for the journey
- **Chengdu/Chen Du:** The warlord Li Deng's fortress where Kate is held captive
- **Kathmandu:** A stopover on the escape route featuring additional challenges
- **Istanbul:** A pivotal location involving palace infiltration
- **Orient Express:** The famous train serves as a key escape route
- **Paris:** The potential final destination for the successful ending[^ref-12]

Time plays a crucial role in Heart of China—it is "an ever-present companion. Even when the character doesn't do anything at all, time still progresses. This can sometimes be fatal"[^ref-12].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The game features puzzles with multiple solutions, encouraging replayability and allowing players to approach challenges according to their preferred play style[^ref-5]. "What makes this game so riveting and revolutionary (though sadly almost noone noticed it) is the true replayability" offered by these branching paths[^ref-18].

Heart of China incorporates optional arcade-style action sequences, including tank simulation and flight segments, that can be skipped by players who prefer traditional adventure gameplay[^ref-19]. The game automatically awards success after a number of failures for "dexterity-impaired players," ensuring that action sequences don't become insurmountable barriers to progress[^ref-18].

The Romance Meter feature tracks the developing relationship between Jake and Kate based on player dialogue choices and actions, ultimately affecting which ending the player receives[^ref-13]. However, some reviewers noted that often "the blandest, least humorous response is the correct one" when it comes to dialogue choices[^ref-4].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Heart of China received strong reviews upon release, with critics praising its cinematic presentation and innovative gameplay mechanics. PC Review awarded the game 4.17 out of 5, describing it as "another attempt at producing an interactive movie" that is "notable for its arcade subsections and - more importantly - its beautiful digitised graphics"[^ref-20]. ACE magazine gave an exceptional score of 910 out of 1000, while Dragon magazine awarded a perfect 5 out of 5 stars[^ref-3].

Computer Gaming World praised the game effusively: "Heart of China is everything a good adventure movie should be: fast-paced, tense, ingenious, witty, varied of locale and light of plot. Above all, it is entertaining"[^ref-3]. The game was praised for successfully capturing the spirit of adventure serials and pulp fiction while offering genuine player agency through its branching narrative structure.

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospectives have been more mixed, with critics acknowledging the game's technical achievements while noting certain limitations. Adventure Classic Gaming awarded the game 3 out of 5, with reviewer Ronny Zuschke stating that "Heart of China is not a game that is to be forgotten by fans familiar with the history of the adventure genre" while praising Dynamix for "having done literally everything to satisfy the player's needs"[^ref-16].

Steve Wilkins of Lemon Amiga gave the Amiga version 5 out of 10, noting: "If I have to describe this title with one word, it would be 'shallow'" but acknowledging that "the strength of the game lies rather in the technical presentation. Particularly, the graphics are of superior quality"[^ref-13]. Some players found the experience "pretty difficult and boring" while others felt it would have been "among the AAA games line up" of its era[^ref-21][^ref-2].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** 78% (based on user reviews)[^ref-8]
- **IMDB:** 7.3/10[^ref-22]
- **GOG User Reviews:** 3.8/5 (12 reviews)[^ref-2]
- **OldGames.sk:** 70%[^ref-23]
- **Amiga Reviews:** 93%[^ref-24]

## Development

### Origins

Heart of China emerged from Dynamix's experimentation with interactive storytelling following their acquisition by Sierra On-Line in 1990[^ref-4]. The game was designed by [[Jeff Tunnell]], who had previously overseen Rise of the Dragon and would later direct The Adventures of Willy Beamish—together forming a trilogy of adventure games using the Dynamix Game Development System[^ref-7]. Tunnell's vision was to create an experience that felt like an interactive movie, drawing explicit inspiration from adventure films like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Romancing the Stone[^ref-5].

The game's plot bears notable similarities to the 1983 film High Road to China starring Tom Selleck, featuring a similar premise of a pilot hired to rescue someone in 1930s Asia[^ref-4]. The development team embraced this pulp adventure aesthetic, aiming to capture the same sense of globe-trotting excitement that the Indiana Jones franchise had popularized.

### Production

Production of Heart of China was an ambitious undertaking that lasted over a year[^ref-6]. The game employed a cast of nearly 100 actors, all of whom were recruited from Dynamix employees and their families due to the tight production budget[^ref-3][^ref-8]. Damon Slye, the Dynamix hero known for his simulation games, appeared among the cast as a British official[^ref-6].

The actors were filmed against a white (or blue) screen and then superimposed onto the hand-painted background artwork[^ref-6]. The background pictures were drawn on paper first, then scanned and digitally enhanced to create the lush, detailed environments that define the game's visual style[^ref-13]. One reviewer noted that "every one of them is beautifully hand-painted. I could happily hang any one of them in a gallery were it not for the pixelated resolutions of 1991"[^ref-4].

**Development Credits:**[^ref-8]
- **Designer:** [[Jeff Tunnell]]
- **Composers:** Don Latarski, Christopher Stevens
- **Cast Member:** [[Damon Slye]] (British official)

### Technical Achievements

Heart of China utilized the Dynamix Game Development System (DGDS), the same proprietary engine that powered Rise of the Dragon[^ref-7]. The engine supported multiple graphics modes including VGA (256 colors), EGA (16 colors), CGA, and MCGA, ensuring compatibility across a wide range of PC configurations[^ref-5].

The visual presentation represented a significant technical achievement for its time. The game used 256 colors in its VGA mode to render both the digitized actor sprites and the detailed hand-painted backgrounds[^ref-3]. The artwork technique—combining live actor photography with traditional painted backgrounds—created a distinctive aesthetic that set the game apart from its contemporaries.

The game also featured a 3D flight simulator demonstration that served as advertising for Dynamix's Red Baron simulation[^ref-13], showcasing the studio's expertise in both adventure and simulation genres.

### Version History

| Version | Date | Platform | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| 1.0 | 1991 | DOS | Initial release[^ref-3] |
| 1.0 | 1991 | Amiga | Console conversion with reduced colors[^ref-13] |
| 1.0 | 1992 | Macintosh | Mac conversion[^ref-8] |

**Additional DOS Versions:**[^ref-8]
- 16-color EGA version for PC and Tandy
- 2-color CGA/MCGA version for older systems

### Technical Issues

The Amiga version suffered from several technical limitations compared to the DOS original. The color palette was reduced from 256 colors to 32 colors, resulting in a less visually impressive presentation[^ref-13]. Players with only 1MB of memory reported poor audio quality, and the 9-disk configuration required frequent disk swapping during gameplay[^ref-13].

The game's design includes potential dead-ends where players can become stuck if they forget to pick up essential items before leaving certain locations[^ref-4]. Additionally, incorrect dialogue choices can sometimes result in instant death, a design decision that frustrated some players[^ref-4].

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- **Dynamix Cast Appearances:** Nearly 100 actors appear in the game, virtually all of whom were Dynamix employees and their family members. Notable among them is Damon Slye, creator of Red Baron and other Dynamix simulations, who appears as a British official[^ref-6][^ref-8].
- **Film Influences:** The game draws explicit inspiration from Raiders of the Lost Ark and Romancing the Stone, with one reviewer noting it "plays out an awful lot like an Indiana Jones movie—the American protagonist, the ethnic sidekick, the love interest that isn't actually interested"[^ref-19].
- **Alternative Title:** The game was known internally as "Shanghai Surprise" during development[^ref-6].
- **Red Baron Advertisement:** The game includes a playable 3D flight simulator demonstration that serves as advertising for Dynamix's Red Baron simulation game[^ref-13].
- **Only Quarter in China:** Despite the title, only the first quarter of the game actually takes place in China; the remainder spans multiple countries across Asia and Europe[^ref-19].

### Multiple Endings

Heart of China features multiple endings based on player choices throughout the game, tracked primarily through the Romance Meter system[^ref-13]. The game's outcome depends on:

- **Romance Meter Status:** The relationship level between Jake and Kate
- **Key Decision Points:** Specific choices made during crucial story moments
- **Character Survival:** Whether certain characters survive the adventure

Possible endings include marriage between Jake and Kate, or alternatively "ending up in a ditch"[^ref-11]. The "best" ending involves all three main characters celebrating their success with champagne in a Parisian five-star hotel room[^ref-14].

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Heart of China represented one of Dynamix's most ambitious adventure game projects, though it did not spawn the series that some reviewers felt it deserved[^ref-8]. Following its release, Dynamix made the strategic decision to exit the adventure game market entirely, shifting focus to simulation and strategy games—genres where the studio had already established significant expertise through titles like Red Baron[^ref-6].

### Collections

Heart of China became available digitally through GOG.com on November 8, 2017, pre-packaged with DOSBox for modern system compatibility[^ref-21][^ref-26]. This release marked the game's return to commercial availability after years of existing primarily in the abandonware community. The GOG version includes both the original game and German language support[^ref-26].

### Critical Perspective

Heart of China occupies a unique position in adventure gaming history as both a technical achievement and a commercial swan song. As Dynamix's final adventure game before the studio pivoted to simulations, it represents the culmination of Jeff Tunnell's vision for interactive cinema—a vision that would influence countless games in the decades to come[^ref-6].

The game's innovative use of multiple solution paths and branching narratives anticipated design philosophies that would become standard in later adventure games. Its "true replayability" was noted as "revolutionary (though sadly almost noone noticed it)"[^ref-18], suggesting the game was perhaps ahead of its time in offering meaningful player choice.

From a technical standpoint, Heart of China demonstrated the potential of combining live-action elements with traditional artwork, a technique that would be refined and expanded in the FMV game explosion of the mid-1990s. While some critics found the story "superficial and unsatisfying"[^ref-18], others praised "the inherent silliness to the whole affair" as evidence that "Dynamix clearly loved the story they worked so hard for"[^ref-19].

The game serves as an important artifact of early 1990s game design philosophy, demonstrating both the ambitions and limitations of attempting to create truly cinematic interactive experiences before CD-ROM technology made full-motion video practical. Its legacy lives on as "one of the most graphically stunning PC games of the era" and a testament to Dynamix's creative ambitions during their brief foray into adventure gaming[^ref-4].
