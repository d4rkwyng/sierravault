## Overview

Hunter Hunted is a side-scrolling action computer game developed by [[Dynamix]] under Sierra's K.A.A. (Kill All Aliens) label and published by [[Sierra On-Line]] in November 1996[^ref-1]. The game takes players "out of reality and throws you into a side-scrolling, action-filled, gut-wrenching game" that offers a choice between playing as either a human named Jake or a beast named Garathe Den[^ref-2]. Set in a dystopian future where Earth has been conquered by brutal alien overlords, the game combines run-and-gun gameplay with platforming elements and an innovative multiplayer component.

The game distinguished itself from other platformers of its era by introducing what developers called "the third dimension of 2D," allowing characters to move into doors and access different layers of the game world[^ref-3]. This mechanic, combined with split-screen cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes, made Hunter Hunted stand out in a crowded market where "decent arcade games on PC are still hard to come by"[^ref-4]. Critics noted it as "a strong showing in the world of side-scrolling platform shooters" that bucked the trend of poor PC platformers at the time[^ref-1].

Hunter Hunted was part of Sierra's broader strategy during the mid-1990s to expand beyond their traditional adventure game catalog into more action-oriented titles. The game is connected to the Metaltech: Earthsiege universe, serving as a prequel that establishes the invasion of the Masters[^ref-1]. With 65 single-player missions and 35 multiplayer missions across cooperative and head-to-head modes, the game offered substantial content for players seeking "aimless but exciting thrills that you can play in small chunks at a time"[^ref-4].

## Story Summary

The year is 2015, and Earth has fallen to a technologically superior race of brutal alien warriors known as the Masters[^ref-6]. In a matter of days, five billion humans were exterminated, leaving humankind all but obliterated[^ref-7]. The Masters have invaded many planets throughout the galaxy, systematically exterminating or enslaving their populations[^ref-6]. Among their conquered worlds is Kullrathe, home to a minotaur-like species that has also been subjugated by these ruthless overlords.

The Masters, seeking entertainment from the conquered species, have established a gladiatorial competition where champions from different worlds are forced to compete against each other in deadly arenas. "You are the perfect specimen—the biggest, the baddest, the best of the best," the game declares, establishing the players' role as champions selected for this brutal contest[^ref-8]. The human champion is Jake, a muscle-bound, chisel-jawed warrior who represents Earth's last hope for dignity[^ref-4]. His opponent is Garathe Den, the minotaur-like warrior champion of the planet Kullrathe[^ref-4].

The competitions take place in abandoned urban environments—dark alleys, office buildings, and even abandoned malls—that have become the Masters' gladiatorial arenas[^ref-2]. Players must navigate through these hostile environments, battling not only each other but also the various dangers the Masters have placed throughout the arenas. The ultimate goal is to collect all the car parts needed to build an escape vehicle called the SCURVe, which will allow the champion to escape from the evil Masters[^ref-9][^ref-10].

The narrative frames the competition as a struggle for survival where "if you've never owed your life to someone before, you will now," hinting at the cooperative elements where former enemies must sometimes work together against their common oppressors[^ref-11]. The game explores themes of resistance, survival, and the unlikely alliances that form when beings from different worlds face a common threat.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Hunter Hunted is a side-scrolling action game that supports multiple input methods including keyboard, mouse, and gamepad/joystick[^ref-10]. The game utilizes a side view perspective that was common to platformers of the era, but distinguishes itself with what the developers described as "the third dimension of 2D"[^ref-3]. This innovative feature allows characters to move into doors in the rear wall of the screen, effectively creating a layered environment where players can transition between different planes of the level[^ref-12].

The control scheme accommodates the game's fast-paced action, allowing players to run, jump, and shoot simultaneously while navigating complex level layouts. Each playable character has distinct capabilities that affect how players approach the game: Jake relies on sophisticated weaponry and ranged attacks, while Garathe Den possesses superior strength and stamina for more melee-focused combat[^ref-12].

### Structure and Progression

The game features a substantial amount of content spread across multiple game modes[^ref-13]:

- **Single Player Campaign:** 65 missions where players select either Jake or Garathe Den and progress through increasingly difficult arenas[^ref-7]
- **Two-Player Cooperative:** 15 missions designed for two players working together against AI enemies[^ref-7]
- **Two-Player Head-to-Head:** 20 missions where two players compete directly against each other in split-screen[^ref-7]

Each mission tasks players with navigating through the arena, defeating enemies, and reaching the stage exit alive[^ref-14]. The difficulty varies across missions, with three selectable difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard[^ref-11]. Head-to-head mode allows players to set timers and minimum kill requirements, adding competitive structure to the versus matches[^ref-11].

The split-screen multiplayer was particularly notable for the era, providing both cooperative and competitive experiences that could be enjoyed locally.[^ref-12] An optional add-on mission pack extended the content with 15 new single-player missions, 2 new head-to-head missions, and 3 cooperative missions[^ref-1].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

While primarily an action game, Hunter Hunted incorporates puzzle elements into its level design. Players must "jump and run through a great amount of levels, solving different riddles and killing your enemies"[^ref-15]. The environmental design includes traps and hazards placed by the Masters that players must navigate or disable.[^ref-8]

The two playable characters offer significantly different gameplay experiences. Jake, the human champion, comes equipped with sophisticated weaponry that emphasizes ranged combat[^ref-12]. Garathe Den, in contrast, relies on his superior physical attributes—greater strength and stamina—making him better suited for close-quarters combat[^ref-12]. This character asymmetry becomes particularly important in multiplayer modes, where players can choose different characters to complement each other in cooperative play or to exploit specific advantages in head-to-head competition.[^ref-4]

Resource management plays a role as players must collect parts throughout the game to ultimately build the SCURVe escape vehicle[^ref-10]. The "kill-em-all type game" design encourages aggressive play, but environmental awareness and strategic positioning remain important for survival[^ref-2].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Hunter Hunted received generally positive reviews upon release, with critics praising its action gameplay and innovative features. GameSpot's Chris Hudak awarded the game a 7 out of 10, describing it as "a level-hopping step in the right direction" for the genre[^ref-1]. Hudak acknowledged that while the game had room for improvement, it represented solid progress in bringing console-style action games to the PC platform.

Next Generation magazine offered praise in their March 1997 coverage, calling Hunter Hunted "a strong showing in the world of side-scrolling platform shooters"[^ref-1]. The publication recognized the game's competence in a genre that was still finding its footing on personal computers.

Old PC Gaming's retrospective noted that "decent arcade games on PC are still hard to come by, so if you're looking for some aimless but exciting thrills that you can play in small chunks at a time, you could do a hell of a lot worse than this"[^ref-4]. The review highlighted the game's accessibility and pick-up-and-play nature as strengths.

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospective analysis has been kind to Hunter Hunted, with many reviewers describing it as an underrated gem from the era. MobyGames contributor Tomer Gabel wrote that it is "an innovative platform game with many twists" and declared it "a completely underrated action game"[^ref-5]. The Digital Antiquarian characterized the game as "a refreshingly light-hearted, fast-playing change of pace from the more ponderous epics which dominated to either side of it"[^ref-16].

The game has developed a cult following among retro gaming enthusiasts, with players continuing to discover and complete it decades after release. Online communities have shared their experiences finishing the game on modern hardware like the Steam Deck[^ref-9].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** 7.3/10[^ref-5]
- **IMDB:** 8.2/10[^ref-14]
- **MyAbandonware (HOTUD):** 4.7/5[^ref-17]

## Development

### Origins

Hunter Hunted was developed by Dynamix, a subsidiary of Sierra On-Line known for their work on flight simulators and action games[^ref-1]. The game was released under Sierra's K.A.A. (Kill All Aliens) label, which was part of Sierra's strategy to diversify their game portfolio beyond traditional adventure titles[^ref-17]. The K.A.A. line represented Sierra's push into more action-oriented, arcade-style games during the mid-1990s.

The game's connection to the Metaltech: Earthsiege universe provided narrative context for the alien invasion scenario. Set as a prequel to the Earthsiege games, Hunter Hunted established the backstory of the Masters' conquest of Earth[^ref-1]. The story even references a religious figure named Jake Hunter within this shared universe[^ref-1].

### Production

Development at Dynamix focused on creating an accessible action game that would appeal to players seeking fast-paced entertainment. The team designed the game around the concept of asymmetric gameplay, with two distinct playable characters offering different approaches to combat[^ref-12]. The split-screen multiplayer component required significant technical work to ensure smooth performance across both cooperative and competitive modes.

The Collection Chamber noted that Hunter Hunted "bucked the trend of poor PC platformers at the time"[^ref-8]. PC action games in the mid-1990s often struggled to match the polish of console titles, but Dynamix's experience with action-oriented games helped them create a more refined product.

### Technical Achievements

Hunter Hunted's most significant technical innovation was its implementation of the "third dimension of 2D" concept[^ref-3]. This allowed players to enter doors on the rear wall of the screen, creating a sense of depth in what was otherwise a traditional side-scrolling environment. The mechanic added strategic complexity to level navigation and combat scenarios.

The game supported split-screen multiplayer for both cooperative and competitive play, allowing two players to engage simultaneously on a single machine[^ref-12]. This local multiplayer implementation was notable for maintaining visual clarity and performance while dividing the screen between two active gameplay sessions.

### Critical Perspective

Hunter Hunted occupies an interesting position in gaming history as part of Sierra's diversification strategy during the mid-1990s. While Sierra On-Line was primarily known for their adventure game catalog—the King's Quest, Space Quest, and Leisure Suit Larry series—the company recognized the growing market for action games on PC. The K.A.A. label represented an attempt to capture this audience, and Hunter Hunted was one of its more successful offerings.

The game's innovation in creating depth within a 2D framework anticipated later developments in the genre, where games would increasingly blur the lines between two-dimensional and three-dimensional gameplay. Its split-screen multiplayer implementation was also ahead of its time for PC gaming, offering local competitive and cooperative play that was more commonly associated with console titles.

Despite positive reviews and a solid technical foundation, Hunter Hunted never achieved the iconic status of Sierra's adventure games. The Collection Chamber's assessment that it was "completely underrated" reflects a common sentiment among those who have discovered the game[^ref-5]. As retro gaming has grown in popularity, Hunter Hunted has found new appreciation from players seeking quality action games from the Windows 95 era.
