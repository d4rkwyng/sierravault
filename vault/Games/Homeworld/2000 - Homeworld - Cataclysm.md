# Homeworld: Cataclysm

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

Homeworld: Cataclysm is a standalone real-time strategy sequel to the acclaimed Homeworld, developed by Barking Dog Studios and published by Sierra Entertainment in 2000[^ref-1]. Originally conceived as an expansion pack, the game grew in scope to become a full standalone title that impressed Sierra enough to warrant independent release[^ref-2]. Set fifteen years after the events of the original Homeworld, the game follows the mining vessel Kuun-Lan of Kiith Somtaaw as they encounter an ancient alien threat known as The Beast[^ref-3].

The game utilizes a modified version of the original Homeworld engine, maintaining the series' signature three-dimensional space combat while introducing significant gameplay improvements and interface enhancements[^ref-4]. Unlike the original Homeworld, Cataclysm features a moveable mothership and focuses on a smaller, more personal story centered around a mining clan rather than the epic journey of an entire civilization[^ref-5]. The game was developed in approximately eight months[^ref-30], with audio production beginning in October 1998 immediately after the first Homeworld's completion[^ref-31].

## Story Summary

The game takes place fifteen years after the Kushan people have returned to their homeworld of Hiigara and established themselves as the Hiigarans[^ref-8]. The story focuses on Kiith Somtaaw, a minor mining clan operating the converted mining vessel Kuun-Lan[^ref-9]. During a routine mining operation, the crew discovers an ancient alien artifact that contains a hostile cybernetic organism known as The Beast[^ref-10].

The Beast functions as a biomechanical parasite that converts any biological and technological systems it encounters, immediately turning them to its purpose[^ref-11]. As the infection spreads throughout the galaxy, converting ships and entire fleets, the modest mining clan finds itself thrust into a desperate struggle for survival. The player must guide the Kuun-Lan and its crew as they battle to contain and ultimately destroy this ancient threat before it consumes all life in the galaxy[^ref-12].

The narrative is delivered through Campbell Lane's narration, who also reprises his role as the voice of the Bentusi from the original game[^ref-2]. Additional voice acting was provided by Scott Swanson as Fleet Command, Heidi Ernest as Fleet Intelligence, and a cast including Brendan Beiser, Graem Castell, Arinn Dembo, and David Sobolov[^ref-32]. The story maintains the series' themes of survival and homecoming while introducing elements of cosmic horror through The Beast's relentless conversion of organic and mechanical life. As one reviewer noted, the Beast virus functions like "a cross between Ebola and Star Trek's Borg"[^ref-33].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Cataclysm retains the fully three-dimensional gameplay of its predecessor, allowing players to command fleets with complete freedom of movement across three axes[^ref-6]. The game features several significant interface improvements over the original Homeworld, including enhanced user interface elements and new mission scenarios[^ref-1]. Players can utilize time compression up to 8x normal speed and enjoy completely free camera rotation while focusing on individual ships or entire fleets[^ref-4].

The game includes a comprehensive tutorial system to help players navigate the complex 3D space environment[^ref-13]. Unlike the original Homeworld, the mothership (Kuun-Lan) is capable of movement, providing greater tactical flexibility[^ref-14]. The interface supports both hardware 3D acceleration and software rendering modes[^ref-4]. Graphically, as one contemporary reviewer noted, "H:C is in a league by itself" with resolution options up to 1600x1200 providing "one helluva recreation of the battles similar to those seen on Babylon 5"[^ref-34].

### Structure and Progression

The single-player campaign consists of 17 missions that follow the escalating threat of The Beast[^ref-6]. Unlike Homeworld's resource conservation focus, Cataclysm provides players with more strategic options and diversification opportunities in both fleet composition and tactical approaches[^ref-15]. The game features 18 all-new ship types and 25 new technologies to research and deploy[^ref-4].

Players begin with the Kuun-Lan, a converted mining vessel that serves as the command ship and the only critical vessel in the game - losing it results in immediate mission failure[^ref-9]. The campaign gradually introduces new ship types and technologies as the player progresses through the story, culminating in massive fleet battles against Beast-infected vessels.

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The game introduces several innovative mechanics, most notably The Beast race, which functions as an alien biomechanical parasite that converts any units that come into close proximity to infected Beast units[^ref-16]. This creates unique strategic challenges as players must balance aggressive tactics with the risk of losing their own ships to conversion.

New unit types include the Mimic fighter, which can perfectly imitate other units and objects including asteroids, and the Ramming Frigate, which sacrifices itself by ramming into hostile ships[^ref-16]. The game also features more complex home-base management compared to the original[^ref-17]. Ships can gain experience and level up throughout the campaign[^ref-35]. The game introduces support modules that limit ship construction, adding another layer of strategic resource management[^ref-36]. Some missions require specific puzzle-like solutions, adopting a trial-and-error approach that can frustrate some players but adds strategic depth[^ref-5].

### Modern Assessment

The game maintains an aggregate Metacritic score of 89/100, indicating "universal acclaim"[^ref-18]. Modern retrospective reviews continue to praise the game's improvements over the original Homeworld. Brian Wright of GamePro noted it "shows what can happen when developers listen to the fans and make changes according to their suggestions and complaints"[^ref-1]. Samuel Bass of NextGen called it "one of those rare sequels in which more of the same is definitely a good thing"[^ref-19]. FiringSquad declared "The gameplay of the Homeworld series is now cemented as revolutionary. Games in the future will either draw upon this series as influence, or out and out steal its ideas"[^ref-37].

The GOG.com re-release as "Homeworld: Emergence" maintains a strong 4.6/5 user rating based on 156 reviews[^ref-3]. Players consistently praise the game's horror atmosphere, with one reviewer noting "it still is the scariest RTS I know"[^ref-3]. On ModDB, the community has given the game a 9.8/10 rating[^ref-45], with users calling it "Best game ever" and "a great sequel to the original game"[^ref-45]. IMDb users have rated the game 8.4/10[^ref-46]. The game is described by many as effectively combining "a space-based strategy game with an organic B-movie horror plot"[^ref-47].

## Development

### Origins

Homeworld: Cataclysm began development at Barking Dog Studios, a company founded in 1998 by former Radical Entertainment employees[^ref-19]. The studio initially assisted Relic Entertainment with the original Homeworld before moving on to create what would become Cataclysm[^ref-21]. Mark Hood, Sierra Studios Senior VP, stated "We believe Barking Dog Studios has the talent and experience to make a significant contribution to the Homeworld franchise"[^ref-22].

Originally designed as an add-on to the original Homeworld, the project was expanded into a full standalone title when it exceeded the scope of a typical expansion pack[^ref-23]. The development team was given significant creative freedom to build upon and improve the original Homeworld formula.

### Production

The game was developed using a modified version of the original Homeworld engine created by Relic Entertainment[^ref-24]. Key designers included Alex Garden, Chris Stewart, Christopher Mair, and Martin Cirulis[^ref-6]. According to Chris Stewart, who later became a producer at Kerberos Studios, "Cataclysm existed in a weird space where Sierra wanted an expansion to the series, but Relic wanted it separated from the main line, hence the 'standalone expansion' marketing oxymoron"[^ref-48]. Stewart also noted that "Relic was pretty dismissive of Cataclysm, so I don't know what they would or would not have saved" regarding the source code[^ref-48].

The voice cast featured Campbell Lane returning as both the narrator and voice of the Bentusi, with Scott Swanson voicing Fleet Command and Heidi Ernest as Fleet Intelligence[^ref-2]. Additional voice actors included Peter Flemming, Pam Hyatt, Joe Keithly, Rob Morton, Sam Vincent, and designer Martin Cirulis himself[^ref-32].

The musical score was composed by Greg Sabitz and Paul Ruskay, with Studio X Labs contributing additional audio work[^ref-2]. According to Paul Ruskay, "The Cataclysm soundtrack has some really interesting ambiences that fit with the game's sci-fi horror tone set in the Homeworld universe"[^ref-25]. Ruskay explained that audio assets were stored on various media including Jazz and Zip Drives, Hard Drives, and DAT tapes[^ref-31]. Regarding the audio preservation process, Ruskay noted "The innate character of a person's phrasing or a musical flourish is something that is nearly impossible to recreate"[^ref-49].

### Technical Achievements

The game featured impressive technical specifications for its time, supporting resolutions up to 1600x900 for 16:9 monitors and 1440x900 for 16:10 monitors[^ref-26]. Save times were remarkably fast at 0.5-1 seconds even for large maps, a feat that impressed contemporary reviewers who were "stumped" by how developers achieved this performance[^ref-50]. The audio system utilized a proprietary frequency-based engine with real-time filtering capabilities created using RAD Game Tools' Relic Audio Tool (RAT)[^ref-4].

Cataclysm required a Pentium II 266 MHz processor minimum, with 32 MB RAM and 300 MB of storage space[^ref-6]. The game supported up to 8 players in multiplayer mode via the now-defunct WON.net network, which shut down on November 1, 2008[^ref-51]. A patch (version 1.01) was released on December 21, 2000 to resolve balance issues and various bugs, though it rendered previous save files incompatible[^ref-52].

## Legacy

Homeworld: Cataclysm was nominated for several industry awards, including Strategy Game of the Year by Computer Gaming World and GameSpot, as well as graphics and strategy game awards from The Electric Playground[^ref-1]. Brian Rubin of Space Game Junkie noted "I've been told many a time it's the best in the series"[^ref-48]. Many fans and critics consider it the better sequel compared to Homeworld 2[^ref-45]. Despite critical acclaim, the game's legacy was complicated by the loss of its source code, preventing it from being included in later Homeworld remasters[^ref-28].

According to a 2013 forum post, "Cataclysm's gone. No backups exist of its sourcecode afaik. Relic didn't consider it canon anyway"[^ref-19]. Code copies had originally existed at Barking Dog, Relic, and Sierra, but "all original code assets are lost - Sierra's gone, Barking Dog's gone"[^ref-48]. Potential backups may exist on Rockstar servers since Barking Dog was acquired by Take-Two Interactive in 2002 and renamed Rockstar Vancouver[^ref-21]. Gearbox Software's Brian Martel confirmed in 2015: "We don't know where it exists. We would love to do something with the game"[^ref-28]. However, GOG.com successfully released the game in 2017 as "Homeworld: Emergence" (renamed due to Blizzard trademarking "Cataclysm" for their World of Warcraft expansion)[^ref-54], suggesting some version was recovered. User reactions expressed surprise: "Everyone thought the source code for Cataclysm was lost, even Gearbox itself"[^ref-3].

The game's canonical status within the Homeworld universe remains ambiguous. Dan Irish, Homeworld 2 Executive Producer, stated that "the events of Cataclysm are not mentioned in Homeworld 2, but they are accepted as having occurred," while Gearbox has indicated that "Cataclysm will be canon when it is necessary to progress the story"[^ref-2]. The game spawned a devoted community, including fan-created comic strips known as "Catatoons" that were created by a community member named Troff[^ref-55]. Modding efforts continue today, including a "Cataclysm Remastered" project that ports the game into the Homeworld Remastered engine[^ref-56].
