# Homeworld Remastered Collection

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

Homeworld Remastered Collection is a comprehensive restoration of [[Relic Entertainment]]'s groundbreaking space real-time strategy games, released on February 25, 2015 by [[Gearbox Software]][^ref-1]. The collection includes fully remastered versions of Homeworld (1999) and Homeworld 2 (2003), alongside the original "Classic" versions of both games, preserving one of the most influential RTS franchises in gaming history[^ref-2]. Publisher 2K Games described it as "THE LEGENDARY RTS—REBORN," a project "crafted with the assistance and guidance of the original creators as well as the help of a passionate fan community"[^ref-3].

The original Homeworld, released September 28, 1999, revolutionized the real-time strategy genre by introducing fully three-dimensional space combat, allowing players to command fleets that could move in all directions—up, down, backward, forward, and to either side—rather than being confined to a traditional two-dimensional plane[^ref-4]. As IGN declared at its original release, "Relic not only tackled space, but may have just changed strategy games forever"[^ref-5]. The game received universal acclaim, achieving a Metacritic score of 93 and earning numerous Game of the Year awards in 1999[^ref-6].

Gearbox Software acquired the Homeworld intellectual property for $1.35 million at THQ's bankruptcy auction in April 2013, rescuing the beloved franchise from legal limbo after the games had spent twelve years in THQ's vaults[^ref-7]. The remastering process took approximately two years, during which the development team worked with original artists and key members of the original development team to rebuild both games using the Homeworld 2 engine, adding support for HD, UHD, and 4K resolutions while maintaining the essence of the originals[^ref-8]. Brian Martel, Gearbox's Chief Creative Officer, emphasized that the studio had "great love and respect for Relic's brilliant, fun and innovative game"[^ref-9].

## Story Summary

The Homeworld saga begins on the desert planet of Kharak, where the Kushan people have lived for thousands of years, unaware of their true origins. "100 years ago, a satellite detected an object under the sands of the Great Desert. An expedition was sent. An ancient starship, buried in the sand. Deep inside the ruin was a single stone that would change the course of our history forever. On the stone was etched a galactic map and a single word more ancient than the clans themselves: 'Hiigara'. Our home"[^ref-12]. This discovery reveals that the Kushan are not native to Kharak but exiles from a distant homeworld[^ref-13].

The Kushan spend sixty years constructing the Mothership, a massive spacecraft-constructing vessel capable of carrying them across the galaxy to reclaim their ancestral home[^ref-14]. Central to this endeavor is Karan S'jet, who integrates herself into the Mothership's systems to become Fleet Command, sacrificing her physical independence to guide her people through the stars[^ref-15]. As the Mothership prepares for its maiden hyperspace jump, the Taiidan Empire discovers Kharak and destroys it utterly in retaliation for the Kushan developing forbidden hyperspace technology. The devastating moment is captured in Karan's anguished transmission: "No one's left. Everything's gone. Kharak is burning...!"[^ref-16].

The survivors journey across the galaxy with their Mothership, facing pirates, mercenaries, and the forces of the Taiidan Empire as they fight to reach Hiigara[^ref-4]. The narrative draws heavily from science fiction influences, with Alex Garden describing his vision as "a 3D game that looked like you were watching Star Wars but had a storyline like Battlestar Galactica"[^ref-10]. The story was written by Arinn Dembo, an anthropologist and archaeologist who developed the basic social structure and cultural institutions of the Kushan, along with games journalist Martin Cirulis[^ref-17]. This emotional journey through 16 missions became one of gaming's most celebrated narratives, with IGN noting that "Homeworld tells a fantastic, emotional story – something very few real-time strategy games have done"[^ref-2].

Homeworld 2, set years after the events of the first game, continues the saga as the Hiigaran people face a new threat from the Vaygr, a nomadic warrior race seeking control of the galaxy[^ref-18]. The sequel features significantly different ship designs and applications between the Vaygr and Hiigaran factions, expanding the tactical possibilities while maintaining the franchise's signature epic scale space battles[^ref-18].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Homeworld pioneered a revolutionary 3D interface that allowed players to command fleets in fully three-dimensional space. Unlike traditional RTS games that operated on a horizontal plane, Homeworld let players send ships to explore, harvest resources, and engage enemies in all directions[^ref-19]. The game featured "an innovative camera system that focuses on objects instead of places offers easy control over the perspective, allowing the player to follow these units that move freely in open space"[^ref-19]. The cube-shaped mini-map could be zoomed and rotated on all three axes, providing unprecedented spatial awareness[^ref-19].

Alex Garden acknowledged the interface challenges, noting "We had the basic control scheme nailed on day one. Ironing out the details of that basic scheme was a simple two-year task…"[^ref-17]. Interestingly, designer Erin Daly observed that "players who had very little exposure to top-down RTS games had an easier time learning the controls to Homeworld"[^ref-17], suggesting the 3D interface was more intuitive for newcomers than veterans of traditional RTS games. Garden recommended using "baroque mice with wheel and middle button" for optimal control[^ref-17].

### Structure and Progression

The original Homeworld campaign spans 16 missions that tell a continuous story of the Kushan exodus[^ref-20]. A defining feature of the series is the persistent fleet system: ships and resources carry over between missions, creating a genuine sense of attachment to individual units[^ref-4]. Game Informer noted players should "expect to get attached to your ships, which makes dangerous encounters even more intense"[^ref-21]. This persistence means that losses are permanent and victories have lasting impact throughout the campaign.

Key campaign missions include:
- **Return to Kharak** – The devastating discovery of the homeworld's destruction, famously scored to Samuel Barber's "Adagio for Strings"[^ref-22]
- **Diamond Shoals** – Considered "certainly the most annoying mission of the game" due to asteroid hazards[^ref-22]
- **Gardens of Kadesh** – A challenging encounter with the enigmatic Kadeshi
- **Supernova Station** – A race against time near a dying star
- **Tenhauser Gate** – The climactic approach to Hiigara

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Homeworld's gameplay is built on rock-paper-scissors style combat mechanics, with different ship classes countering others[^ref-23]. The game features two playable races—the Kushan and Taiidan—with similar unit rosters but distinct visual designs[^ref-24]. Players must balance resource harvesting, fleet construction, and tactical combat across battles that can involve up to 200 ships[^ref-24].

The Remastered Collection combines all four races (Kushan, Taiidan, Hiigaran, and Vaygr) into a unified multiplayer experience supporting up to 8 players across 23 maps[^ref-25]. The remaster introduced formation improvements, with Gearbox noting that "Formations have been completely rewritten to better support HW1 formations"[^ref-26], addressing long-standing community concerns about tactical unit control.

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

The Homeworld Remastered Collection received overwhelmingly positive reviews upon release, with critics praising the careful restoration of the classic titles. IGN awarded the collection 9.0/10, with Dan Stapleton declaring "Even ignoring Remastered Collection's beautifully enhanced graphics, which would've definitely fooled me into believing these were modern real-time strategy games, the way original developer Relic expertly pulls off a brilliant recreation of the Star Wars-scale space fleet battles is nothing short of amazing"[^ref-2]. He concluded that "Gearbox gives Homeworld the respect it deserves in this impressive refitting of Relic's classic RTS games"[^ref-2].

PC Gamer gave the collection 92/100, with Tom Senior calling it "A worthy upgrade to one of the best strategy games ever, featuring the best space battles in the business" and stating unequivocally that "Homeworld is simply incredible and everyone should play it"[^ref-27]. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd scored it 8/10, noting that "Returning to this universe in Homeworld Remastered Collection illustrates the series' timelessness" while observing that the game "beautifully captures the loneliness of space"[^ref-28].

Game Informer awarded 8/10, with Daniel Tack praising the collection while noting "I can't help but wish that Gearbox had brought some new things to the table beyond adding polish to existing content"[^ref-21]. Destructoid gave 8/10, with Jason Faulkner describing the Homeworld campaign as "Your exodus across the galaxy is a relentless struggle against the odds and is one of my favorite campaigns in video game history"[^ref-11]. GamingTrend awarded a perfect 100, declaring "Gearbox has set the bar for how to update an old game for a modern audience"[^ref-29].

### Original Homeworld Reception (1999)

The original Homeworld achieved legendary status upon its 1999 release, becoming the highest-rated computer game of 1999 on Metacritic with a score of 93[^ref-6]. All Game Guide awarded 100/100, describing it as "Simply one of those titles that makes you say 'Wow.' You'll have to pick your jaw up off the floor when you experience it for the first time"[^ref-6]. Adrenaline Vault also gave 100/100, stating "Beyond the confines of the single player is the best multiplayer strategy game since 'Total Annihilation'"[^ref-6].

GameSpy scored it 93/100, calling it "A truly groundbreaking RTS with no major flaws. The visuals and music are top-notch and the gameplay is on a grand scale. This is the first game I have played where I was truly inspired by the vastness of space"[^ref-6]. PC Gamer gave 93/100, praising the "Engrossing RTS play matched to a vital and visually intense story"[^ref-6]. IGN awarded 95/100, stating "We've rarely played a game with this much substance"[^ref-6].

Eurogamer scored the original 9/10, describing it as "a refreshing new take on the real time strategy genre, abandoning the usual forest, ice, desert and volcanic worlds of most RTS games and instead setting the action in deep space"[^ref-30].

## Development

### Origins

Relic Entertainment was founded on June 1, 1997, specifically to create Homeworld[^ref-10]. The company was established above a nightclub in Vancouver by a small team including Alex Garden, Luke Moloney, Rob Cunningham, Aaron Kambeitz, Gary Shaw, and Shane Alfreds[^ref-39]. Garden was just 22 years old when he founded the company, driven by a singular vision: "Wouldn't it be great if you could have a 3D game that looked like you were watching Star Wars but had a story line like Battlestar Galactica?"[^ref-17].

Garden secured Sierra On-Line's publishing agreement based on "two whiteboard presentations and no demo"[^ref-10], an extraordinary achievement that demonstrated the compelling nature of his vision. His design philosophy was refreshingly honest: "there's no sort of design philosophy behind it. The fact that it's real-time strategy was almost a fluke. The focus was making sure the space combat ruled"[^ref-10]. Garden predicted that "everyone is going to zoom right in on the first battle, just to watch"[^ref-10], recognizing the cinematic appeal of the game's visuals.

### Production

Development of the original Homeworld took over two years, approximately 28 months in total—three times longer than initially estimated[^ref-17]. The team grew to about 20 people, working to create the first fully 3D real-time strategy game[^ref-17]. Garden's management philosophy was pragmatic: "Figure out what you're good at, assume you're lousy at everything else, hire people to do all the things you're lousy at, and get out of their way"[^ref-17].

The game was originally planned to feature non-linear campaign progression with star system navigation, but this was changed to a fixed ladder of scenarios during development[^ref-17]. Other cut features included ship customization, convoy routes, and different unit types between the Kushan and Taiidan fleets[^ref-10]. Sierra was reportedly supportive during the extended development, telling Garden "Prenez le temps nécessaire. Vous y êtes presque, ça serait dommage de tout abandonner si près du but" (Take the time you need. You're almost there, it would be a shame to give up so close to the goal)[^ref-40].

The remastering process by Gearbox took approximately two years, beginning after their April 2013 acquisition[^ref-7]. The team faced significant technical challenges, as the original games were built on entirely different engines. Gearbox programmer noted, "I was a bit surprised when, earlier this year, I was told by a manager at Gearbox we were looking at bidding on the Homeworld franchise"[^ref-41]. The original source code totaled 16.8 GB, with an additional 39 GB from other sources[^ref-42]. Brian Burleson, lead producer, stated "The spirit of the team working on this at Gearbox is very focused on not re-inventing Homeworld"[^ref-42].

### Technical Achievements

Homeworld represented a quantum leap in RTS technology. It was the first major fully 3D RTS game, requiring revolutionary innovations in camera control, pathfinding, and user interface design[^ref-17]. The game originally shipped on a single 650MB CD-ROM[^ref-8]; the Remastered Collection expanded to nearly 20GB[^ref-8], reflecting the massive increase in texture resolution and audio quality.

The original game used OpenGL with DirectX support and was compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 97[^ref-41]. It supported DirectSound, DirectPlay 8, and DirectShow libraries[^ref-41]. The remaster added support for HD, UHD, and 4K resolutions[^ref-3], with the engine rebuilt to use OpenGL 3.3[^ref-25].

Brian Martel of Gearbox emphasized their approach: "We weren't doing a George Lucas on them, we weren't making them overly shiny or plastic or whatever the case may be for the Special Edition versions of Star Wars. We were actually realising their vision as intended"[^ref-43].

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

The original Homeworld sold over 500,000 copies in its first six months[^ref-10], reaching number 1 on UK charts in October 1999[^ref-38]. While commercially successful, it did not challenge StarCraft's sales dominance[^ref-17]. The game became one of Sierra's flagship titles, listed among the company's popular software alongside King's Quest, Grand Prix Legends, and NASCAR Racing[^ref-49].

Following THQ's bankruptcy in January 2013, Gearbox acquired the Homeworld IP at auction for $1.35 million[^ref-11]. A fan group had attempted to raise funds via IndieGogo to acquire the franchise but only collected $13,000[^ref-9]. Nordic Games CEO Lars Wingefors stated at the time: "In the long term, we either want to cooperate with the original creators or best possible developers in order to work on sequels or additional content for these titles"[^ref-8].

Homeworld 3's Fig crowdfunding campaign set a symbolic $1 goal and raised over $1.13 million, reaching "100,000,000% complete"[^ref-51]. The sequel was described as "20 years in the making"[^ref-33].

A **Game of the Year Edition** of the original Homeworld was released in 2000, including the official strategy guide and soundtrack CD[^ref-32].

### Fan Projects

The modding community has been essential to Homeworld's longevity. The **Homeworld Remastered Players Patch** represents a major community effort, resolving "many bugs, exploits, and balance issues" while including "hundreds of additional improvements"[^ref-52]. The patch was "authored by players who helped Gearbox balance Homeworld Remastered" and works with official patches 2.1/2.303[^ref-52]. Key fixes include the "666 Formation Bug" and "Cross Race Docking Bug"[^ref-52].

The **Complex mod** achieved ModDB Hall of Fame status with over 5,000,000 downloads and up to 5,000 daily contacts[^ref-53]. Gearbox worked closely with the mod community during development, with former Homeworld developers and mod makers helping reconstruct development tools[^ref-42]. The company announced Steam Workshop support for mods[^ref-11].

In September 2003, Relic publicly released the original Homeworld source code, enabling continued community development[^ref-41].

### Critical Perspective

Homeworld's place in gaming history is secure as the progenitor of true 3D real-time strategy. PC Gamer's Fraser Brown reflected: "A fully 3D RTS set in space that looked that good didn't seem believable—surely it would end up being all eye candy and nothing else. But no, it was the real deal. From its hypnotic cosmic battles to its stirring orchestral score, it was, and still is, exceptional"[^ref-59]. The game proved that narrative could be central to the RTS experience, not merely decorative.

The franchise's influence extends beyond gaming into other media, with the original Homeworld cited as an influence on the reimagined Battlestar Galactica television series[^ref-16]. Maurice Pogue of Geeks Under Grace declared "Homeworld is the GOAT RTS franchise because it is the only RTS that has ever been able to execute true 3D z-axis movement with mastery"[^ref-60]. Screen Rant noted it "helped to shape the future of the RTS genre" and was the "highest-rated game of 1999 on the review site"[^ref-34].

The Remastered Collection demonstrated how to properly preserve gaming history. Engadget's review concluded: "Homeworld and Homeworld 2 are a pair of beautiful, clever, groundbreaking games that deserve to be played"[^ref-61]. Rob Cunningham, CEO of Blackbird Interactive and original Homeworld art director, reflected: "When we first created the original Homeworld, I never imagined that it would resonate so deeply with so many people"[^ref-33].
