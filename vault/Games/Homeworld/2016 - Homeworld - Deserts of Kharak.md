# Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is a real-time strategy game that serves as a prequel to the classic Homeworld series, taking place over a century before the original game[^ref-1]. Developed by Blackbird Interactive, a studio founded by veterans from the original Homeworld and Company of Heroes development teams[^ref-2], the game represents a bold departure from the space-based setting of its predecessors by placing the action on the desert planet Kharak itself[^ref-3].

Originally conceived as an independent project called Hardware: Shipbreakers, the game was transformed into an official Homeworld title when Gearbox Software acquired the franchise rights during THQ's bankruptcy auction in 2013[^ref-4]. The game successfully translates the core Homeworld experience to ground-based warfare while maintaining the series' signature emphasis on tactical combat, resource management, and compelling narrative[^ref-5]. Released on January 20, 2016, the game was praised for its production values and faithful recreation of the Homeworld atmosphere despite the dramatic change in setting[^ref-6]. The game is set approximately 106 years before the events of the original Homeworld[^ref-37], making it a distant prequel that explores the origins of the Kushan exodus.

## Story Summary

The game follows the story of a dying planet where the inhabitants of Kharak are divided into feuding clans or kiith, jockeying for power and control of the planet's limited resources[^ref-10]. When an orbital satellite discovers a mysterious anomaly deep in the southern deserts, a military expedition is organized and led by Rachel S'jet, the chief science officer[^ref-11]. The expedition's mission is to retrieve a lost artifact that is capable of saving the world from further environmental degradation[^ref-12].

Rachel S'jet serves as the game's protagonist, guiding players through the dangerous desert expedition in search of what becomes known as the "primary anomaly"[^ref-2]. As Rachel narrates in the opening: "Our planet is dying... the desert grows with every passing year"[^ref-36]. The narrative explores themes of survival and desperation as the coalition forces venture deep into enemy territory, encountering the hostile Gaalsien faction that seeks to prevent them from reaching their goal[^ref-13]. The game also explores themes of dogma, societal politics, and environmental collapse[^ref-13]. The story connects directly to the broader Homeworld mythology, ultimately leading to the discovery that would inspire the construction of the great mothership featured in the original game[^ref-14]. A scientist named Karan S'jet would later integrate herself into that mothership as its living core—making Rachel S'jet her ancestor[^ref-40].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls
Players view the battlefield from high in the sky, commanding groups of ground units and aircraft in real-time strategic combat[^ref-15]. The game utilizes a traditional RTS interface where players order units to attack enemies with guns, lasers, and missiles[^ref-15]. A significant addition in patch 1.3.0 was the implementation of Tactical Pause, allowing players to pause the action during campaign and skirmish modes to issue orders—a feature that had become "quite polarizing in the world of RTS games"[^ref-16].

The camera system allows for dynamic battlefield observation, with specific settings that can be adjusted including edge pan speed (defaulting from 50% to 70%) and sensors camera reset functionality[^ref-7]. Unit selection and tactical commands follow established RTS conventions, with players able to group units and issue complex movement and attack orders across the desert terrain[^ref-17]. Players control fleets ranging from light attack vehicles to heavyweight cruisers[^ref-8]. The game manages to feel authentically Homeworld: "It moves like Homeworld, it sounds like Homeworld, and—even when you swap stars for sand—it looks like Homeworld"[^ref-26].

### Structure and Progression
The campaign features 16 missions with a total length of approximately 15 hours[^ref-7]. Unlike traditional RTS games that reset player resources and units between missions, Deserts of Kharak employs a persistent army system where units carry over from mission to mission, requiring careful resource management throughout the campaign[^ref-18]. This design choice sets the gameplay apart from traditional RTS titles where players can often establish resource dominance to ensure victory[^ref-19].

The game features only 7 unit types across 2 factions (Coalition and Gaalsien), emphasizing tactical decision-making over unit variety[^ref-7]. DLC added two additional factions: the Soban (focused on long-range railgun warfare) and the Khaaneph[^ref-43]. Players must balance light units against ranged enemies, armored units against light forces, and railgun units against heavily armored targets[^ref-17]. As one guide notes, "Soban are made for long range and anti armor battles with their railguns but can't fight mass units like sandskimmers or LAVs"[^ref-44]. The multiplayer component supports 2-6 players online with a unit cap of 125 units[^ref-7].

### Puzzles and Mechanics
Resource management forms the core of the strategic experience, with players needing to carefully balance unit production, research, and tactical positioning[^ref-19]. The desert environment introduces unique tactical considerations, with sand dunes providing cover and elevation advantages that affect combat effectiveness[^ref-20]. The game's minimalist design philosophy focuses on essential RTS mechanics, "chiseling the genre down to its bare essentials and iterating upon them with tenacious precision"[^ref-5].

Combat emphasizes combined arms tactics between ground vehicles and aircraft, with air sorties playing a crucial role in battlefield control[^ref-16]. The faction designs showcase an "industrial punk aesthetic at its best," with each side offering distinct tactical advantages and unit compositions[^ref-20].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| GamingTrend | 95/100 | "Fresh but familiar... simply nothing else like it"[^ref-45] |
| PC Gamer | 90/100 | "A great tactical RTS with all the gorgeous aesthetics and atmosphere of the original series"[^ref-21] |
| GameSpot | 9/10 | "Creates believable drama through stellar writing"[^ref-5] |
| IGN | 8.8/10 | "A deep, exciting, varied RTS with all the right tools"[^ref-22] |
| Ragequit.gr | 85/100 | "One of the best single player campaigns the genre has ever witnessed"[^ref-45] |
| MobyGames Critics | 82% | Aggregated critic score[^ref-46] |
| Game Informer | 8/10 | "Definition of a real-time strategy game for RTS fans"[^ref-19] |
| CGMagazine | 8/10 | "Very important breath of life into a dying genre"[^ref-23] |
| Destructoid | 7.5/10 | "Certainly feels like home...world"[^ref-18] |
| IMDb | 7.3/10 | User rating[^ref-47] |
| Hardcore Gamer | 4/5 | "Legitimate claim to being part of the legendary franchise"[^ref-24] |

### Modern Assessment

The game achieved a Metacritic score of 79/100 based on professional reviews[^ref-25] and maintains a 78% positive rating from Steam users based on over 5,000 reviews[^ref-6]. The OpenCritic aggregation shows a 79 Top Critic Average[^ref-8]. Critics praised the game's successful translation of Homeworld's core mechanics to a ground-based setting, with many noting that it managed to feel authentically Homeworld despite the dramatic change in environment[^ref-26]. Rock Paper Shotgun praised the game's audio design, noting that "its sound design casually rewrites the rules of unit chatter"[^ref-33].

Professional reviewers consistently highlighted the game's production values, strategic depth, and faithful recreation of the Homeworld atmosphere. IGN's Leana Hafer described the experience as "like settling into a comfortable, old easy chair, taking a sip of a fine whisky, and ordering a zillion tanks to blow the ever-loving crap out of all that stands in your way"[^ref-22]. However, some criticism focused on the limited unit variety and the absence of certain features like tactical pause at launch[^ref-8]. The game has been recognized as "original because of its large-scale, real-time strategy game in a market dominated by single-character battle arenas like League of Legends"[^ref-20]. StrategyFront Gaming declared it "a worthy successor to the franchise"[^ref-34].

## Development

### Origins
The game's development began as Hardware: Shipbreakers (originally just "HARDWARE" in 2009), an independent project by Blackbird Interactive that was not initially connected to the Homeworld franchise[^ref-27]. Development started in Rob Cunningham's garage[^ref-52], with the studio later moving to a former Finning International warehouse with a gantry crane overhead[^ref-52]. The transformation into an official Homeworld title occurred through what Rob Cunningham described as "divine intervention" rather than "brilliant business strategy"—calling it "blind, fantastic luck" when Gearbox and Blackbird came together[^ref-4]. Randy Pitchford of Gearbox admitted that "We didn't have a clear long-range plan when we started" with the Homeworld IP acquisition[^ref-4].

Gearbox acquired the Homeworld intellectual property for $1.35 million during THQ's bankruptcy auction in April 2013[^ref-28]. Brian Martel, Gearbox's Chief Creative Officer, personally spearheaded the acquisition, with the first priority being "to preserve and assemble the purest form of the original acclaimed and beloved games"[^ref-54]. The acquisition allowed Blackbird Interactive to transform their original project into something "far greater than a spiritual successor to Homeworld ever could have hoped to be"[^ref-2]. This partnership brought together former Relic Entertainment veterans including Rob Cunningham, composer Paul Ruskay, and designer Aaron Kambeitz[^ref-28].

### Production
The development team at Blackbird Interactive emphasized community engagement throughout production, with project director Rory McGuire stating, "Without our fans, we wouldn't be here, we wouldn't have this job, we wouldn't be making this game"[^ref-29]. The studio committed to supporting modding communities, promising "We won't be putting up any legal or code based blocks for modding. We are in support of modders and people experimenting with our game"[^ref-29].

The game's development spanned approximately six years (2009-2016), during which the team faced significant technical and business challenges[^ref-52]. Early version control was primitive—developers used "washers on hooks" before Unity Pro[^ref-52]. The project went through multiple iterations, including a Facebook free-to-play version that was abandoned[^ref-27]. The team had to completely rebuild the entire codebase for deterministic multiplayer simulation[^ref-52]. An upgrade to Unity 5 late in development caused crashes with the 32-bit Unity Editor due to memory issues[^ref-52]. The project represented the first new Homeworld entry "after more than a decade-long hiatus for Homeworld," making it "an immense honor" for the development team to launch new entries in the franchise[^ref-11]. Pre-ordering the game came with a free copy of Homeworld Remastered Collection[^ref-56].

### Technical Achievements
Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak was built using the Unity 5 engine[^ref-7], representing a modern technical foundation for the classic gameplay mechanics. As Yossarian King of Blackbird Interactive noted, "We're happy to be Made With Unity"[^ref-52]. The game requires a minimum of 3 GB RAM and 8 GB storage space, with recommended specifications including 8 GB RAM and 12 GB storage[^ref-9]. The technical implementation supports both 32-bit and 64-bit executables and uses Direct3D 9.0c and Direct3D 11 APIs[^ref-7]. The game supports seven languages including English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Polish, and Russian[^ref-57].

The audio design features Paul Ruskay's musical composition, maintaining the series' signature atmospheric soundtrack[^ref-31]. The soundtrack recording featured the Prague Radio Orchestra for strings and various Indian musicians for traditional instruments recorded at Village Studios in Delhi, India[^ref-31]. The complete soundtrack spans 3 hours and 8 minutes across 117 tracks (including 15 bonus tracks), released in both MP3 and FLAC formats at 16-bit/44.1kHz[^ref-32]. The game includes full voice acting with Rachel S'jet serving as the central narrative voice throughout the campaign[^ref-18]. Speedrun.com tracks competitive runs of the full game, with 10 total runs completed[^ref-59].

## Legacy

Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak successfully revitalized the Homeworld franchise after its lengthy hiatus, proving that the series' core mechanics could translate effectively to different environments[^ref-33]. The game's development approach—transforming an independent project into an official franchise entry—demonstrated innovative methods for continuing classic gaming properties[^ref-34]. The success of the ground-based prequel helped establish foundation lore for the broader Homeworld universe while maintaining the tactical depth and atmospheric storytelling that defined the original games[^ref-35]. The lore connection runs deep: units gain experience and unique names throughout the campaign, including a reference to composer Paul Ruskay (a unit can be named "Rus'kay")[^ref-29].

The game's emphasis on single-player campaign content and traditional RTS mechanics provided "a very important breath of life into a dying genre" at a time when real-time strategy games had become less common in mainstream gaming[^ref-23]. Its release preceded and helped establish groundwork for future Homeworld franchise developments, including the eventual Homeworld 3[^ref-36]. The Expedition Guide companion application, released alongside the game as a $5 DLC on Steam, provided detailed backstory and lore that many compared favorably to the legendary Homeworld 1 manual: "You remember how the Homeworld 1 manual was the greatest thing since sliced bread? Well, this is that for a new era"[^ref-61]. The guide features eleven sections covering different story aspects with developer commentary[^ref-62].

Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak serves as a prequel to the classic Homeworld series, taking place over a century before the events of the original game. The story follows Rachel S'jet, the chief science officer, as she leads a military expedition to retrieve a lost artifact capable of saving the planet from environmental degradation. This narrative thread connects directly to the broader Homeworld mythology, ultimately leading to the discovery that would inspire the construction of the great mothership featured in the original game, creating a cohesive link between Deserts of Kharak and the Homeworld Remastered Collection.

The gameplay in Deserts of Kharak represents a significant evolution from the space-based setting of its predecessors, instead focusing on ground-based warfare while maintaining the series' signature emphasis on tactical combat, resource management, and compelling narrative. The introduction of a persistent army system, where units carry over from mission to mission, adds a new layer of depth to the traditional RTS formula, requiring careful resource management throughout the campaign. This mechanic sets the stage for the next entry in the series, Homeworld 3, which will likely build upon this foundation and further refine the gameplay experience.

As the series continues with Homeworld 3, players can expect a return to the space-based setting of the original games, with the story potentially exploring the consequences of the events set in motion by Rachel S'jet's expedition in Deserts of Kharak. The gameplay may also evolve to incorporate new features and mechanics, such as improved ship customization and larger-scale battles, while maintaining the core elements that have defined the Homeworld series. By building upon the narrative and mechanical foundations established in Deserts of Kharak, Homeworld 3 will offer a fresh and exciting experience for fans of the series, while remaining true to the spirit of the original games.
