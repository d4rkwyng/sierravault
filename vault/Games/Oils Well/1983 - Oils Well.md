## Overview

Oil's Well is an arcade-style maze game developed and published by Sierra On-Line, originally released in 1983 for multiple home computer platforms.[^ref-1] The game tasks players with extending an oil-mining robotic arm deep below the earth's crust to collect oil while avoiding monstrous underground creatures—one touch to the robotic arm results in losing a life.[^ref-2] Designed by Thomas J. Mitchell, Oil's Well represents one of Sierra's forays into the arcade gaming market during the early 1980s, earning recognition as "one of the most original arcade-style titles published this year for the home computer" from *Electronic Fun* magazine.[^ref-3]

The game is widely recognized as a clone or spiritual successor to the 1982 arcade game *Anteater*, re-themed around oil drilling rather than an insectivore consuming ants.[^ref-1] This creative re-skinning gave rise to the game's punning title—a twist on the old saying "all's well."[^ref-4] The appeal lies in the visual puzzle presented to players: calculating whether they can reach oil deposits before underground pests intercept them, and determining the optimal route through the maze-like underground tunnels.[^ref-3]

Oil's Well received a significant remake in 1990 for MS-DOS, developed by Banana Development, Inc. and published by Sierra On-Line.[^ref-5] This version featured dramatically improved 256-color VGA graphics, a new stereo soundtrack by [[Ken Allen]], and animated cartoon sequences featuring "Slater the Petrosaur" between levels.[^ref-6] The game's enduring popularity led to various clones and inspired titles such as *Pipeline Run* (1990) and *Oilmania* (1991).[^ref-1]

## Story Summary

The narrative premise of Oil's Well is minimal but effective, focusing on the urgent need for petroleum resources. Between the layers and layers of the earth's crust are vast, maze-like deposits of oil, and the player's goal is to guide their drill bit through each maze, guzzling every drop of oil before advancing to the next layer.[^ref-8] The gameplay takes on a more elaborate fictional framing in some versions, particularly the 1990 remake.

The 1990 DOS remake introduces a more developed storyline: in the beginning of the 21st century, Earth is experiencing a global oil shortage.[^ref-9] Surprisingly, Tunisia remains one of the few countries still in possession of large quantities of high-quality oil. The USA and Soviet governments race each other in their attempts to purchase as much oil as possible.[^ref-9] This geopolitical backdrop provides context for the player's drilling operations.

The underground world is populated by creatures called "Oozies" that threaten the drilling operation.[^ref-10] These subterranean pests patrol the maze-like oil deposits, and contact with them proves fatal to the player's robotic arm. The 1990 version features "Slater the Petrosaur," a cartoon dinosaur mascot who appears in animated sequences between levels, providing comic relief and narrative continuity.[^ref-5]

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The player controls a drill head that can be extended through underground tunnels using four directional control buttons to navigate through the maze.[^ref-11] A separate button allows the player to quickly retract the drill bit back toward the surface—a crucial defensive maneuver when creatures approach.[^ref-11] The original versions supported joystick control, which was required for the Apple II version, while the 1990 remake added mouse support as an alternative control method.[^ref-4]

The interface presents a side-view perspective of the underground oil deposits, displayed as a fixed flip-screen showing the entire maze.[^ref-2] Players must carefully time their movements, balancing the need to collect oil with the imperative to avoid or eliminate underground threats. The drill bit has a limited lifespan of 990 ticks in the 1990 version, adding time pressure to each level.[^ref-8]

### Structure and Progression

Oil's Well features eight distinct oil fields (mazes) that players must complete.[^ref-11] The game screen consists of a maze filled with oil represented as dots, which the player must collect by guiding their drill bit through the tunnels.[^ref-10] After completing all eight levels, the game cycles back to the beginning with increased difficulty—faster monsters and slower bomb/retraction speed.[^ref-12]

The game offers three difficulty levels in most versions:[^ref-8]
- **Regular (Easy):** Standard gameplay with land mines and goblets available
- **Unleaded (Medium):** Increased challenge with faster enemies
- **Premium (Hard):** Maximum difficulty with no goblets or land mines available

The 1990 remake expanded the content to include 40 levels where players must drill through locations in search of power pills and other bonuses.[^ref-13] This version also added animated cartoon sequences featuring Slater the Petrosaur that play between levels, rewarding progression.[^ref-5]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The core mechanic involves extending the drill bit through the maze to collect oil pellets worth 10 points each.[^ref-8] Special items called goblets appear periodically and are worth 1000 points each, though they're unavailable in hard difficulty mode.[^ref-8] Creatures (Oozies) can be consumed by the drill bit's "mouth" for points—up to 170 points depending on the creature type.[^ref-8]

Land mines appear in some versions as hazards that must be avoided.[^ref-14] The strategic element comes from deciding when to extend the drill and when to retract—extending makes the player vulnerable along the entire length of the arm, while retracting brings the drill head safely back but means losing progress through the maze.[^ref-3] As one reviewer noted, "The appeal of Oil's Well is the visual puzzle: can I get there before they do and what route should I take?"[^ref-3]

The 1990 version supports 1-2 players in a turn-based multiplayer mode, where players alternate turns attempting to achieve the highest score.[^ref-6]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Oil's Well received generally positive reviews upon release, with critics praising its original take on the maze game formula. *Electronic Fun* awarded the Atari 8-bit version a perfect 4/4 score in March 1984, calling it "one of the most original arcade-style titles published this year for the home computer."[^ref-3] The reviewer highlighted that "the appeal of Oil's Well is the visual puzzle: can I get there before they do and what route should I take?"[^ref-3]

*ANALOG Computing* described the game as "a truly different and challenging variant on the 'gobble the dots' theme," acknowledging its debt to Pac-Man while recognizing its unique mechanics.[^ref-1] *Computer Gaming World* reviewer Dave Stone praised the gameplay balance, noting that "the action's well-paced, the difficulty progressive. While getting to a higher level is somewhat dependent on getting the right breaks—good eye-hand coordination, timing, and strategy are essential."[^ref-1]

*Apple User* gave the game 74% in their October 1984 review, with reviewer Cliff McKnight observing "Is this 'Pac-Man meets JR', you ask yourself?" before concluding "Once you've got the knack, it's a great game that will keep you occupied for hours."[^ref-15] French publication *L'Ordinateur Individuel* scored the game at 80% in January 1985, while *Tilt* magazine gave it 66% in June 1984 and a lower 50% in December 1984.[^ref-16]

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospectives have been more mixed, recognizing the game's historical importance while acknowledging its age. Home of the Underdogs noted: "Simple concept, but quite frustrating in reality as those bugs are way too fast at higher levels. The 1990 remake version is much better. Good for nostalgia, but little else."[^ref-17] User reviews on Lemon64 describe the game as having "addictive written all over it,"[^ref-12] while another reviewer characterized it as "Imagine Pacman with a huge extendable neck and you'll get the idea behind this modestly pleasing underground chomper."[^ref-12]

The game maintains a nostalgic appeal, with Classic-Retro-Games tracking over 10,131 downloads of the game.[^ref-13] Community reviewer Father Brad humorously summarized the experience: "We never should've put Pac-Man on a leash. Never!"[^ref-12]

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames (1983 version):** 81% (7 reviews)[^ref-2]
- **MobyGames (1990 version):** 47%[^ref-6]
- **IMDB:** 6.7/10[^ref-18]
- **Atarimania:** 7.8/10[^ref-3]
- **MyAbandonware:** 4.25/5[^ref-17]
- **Classic-Retro-Games:** 3.2/5 (20 gamers)[^ref-13]

## Development

### Origins

Oil's Well was designed by Thomas J. Mitchell, who created the game as an adaptation of the 1982 arcade game *Anteater*.[^ref-1] The re-theming from an anteater consuming insects to a drill collecting oil was a creative decision that gave the game its distinctive identity and punning title.[^ref-4] Unusually for Sierra On-Line at the time, the game was originally written for Atari 8-bit computers rather than the Apple II platform that was the company's traditional primary development target.[^ref-4]

The game's design reflects the era's fascination with energy concerns and resource management, themes that would recur in the 1990 remake's fictional backstory about global oil shortages.[^ref-9] Mitchell's version proved successful enough to warrant ports to numerous platforms throughout 1983-1985, establishing Oil's Well as one of Sierra's notable arcade-style offerings.

### Production

The original 1983 release was developed internally at Sierra On-Line under Mitchell's direction.[^ref-2] Various programmers handled ports to different platforms: R.B. Stuart, Ivan Strand, and Don McGlauflin worked on different versions, while John Rinck developed the IBM PC version.[^ref-4] The Commodore 64 port was also developed by Thomas J. Mitchell.[^ref-12]

The 1990 MS-DOS remake was developed by Banana Development, Inc. rather than Sierra's internal team, and notably proceeded without Thomas J. Mitchell's direct involvement.[^ref-1] This version featured significantly enhanced production values under the creative direction of Bill Davis and production by Guruka Singh Khalsa, with Ken Williams serving as executive producer.[^ref-6]

### Technical Achievements

The 1990 remake represented a significant technical upgrade over the original versions. The game featured enhanced 256-color MCGA/VGA graphics, a dramatic improvement over the limited palettes of the 8-bit home computer originals.[^ref-10] A new stereo soundtrack was composed by Ken Allen, with support for various sound cards including the Roland MT-32, Sound Blaster, and Creative Music System/Game Blaster.[^ref-19]

The remake also featured animated cartoon sequences starring Slater the Petrosaur, which played between levels as rewards for progression.[^ref-5] These animations demonstrated Sierra's increasing interest in multimedia presentation during the early 1990s. The soundtrack was later preserved and released through dedicated archival efforts, recorded from extracted game files using authentic Roland MT-32 hardware.[^ref-19]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Oil's Well earned significant recognition during its original release, winning the 1984 Golden Floppy Award for Excellence in the Maze Game of the Year category from *Computer Games Magazine*.[^ref-1] This award validated the game's quality and Sierra's ability to produce compelling arcade-style titles alongside their adventure game lineup.

The game's commercial success led to ports across virtually every major home computer platform of the era, from American systems like the Apple II, Atari 8-bit, and Commodore 64 to Japanese platforms including the MSX and Sharp X1.[^ref-2] The 1990 remake demonstrated continued market interest in the property, though at a premium price point of $59.95.[^ref-6]

### Collections

The Commodore 64 version was included in Main Street Publishing's "Familiar Favorites IV" disk compilation alongside *Sammy Lightfoot*.[^ref-12] The game was distributed in various territories by different publishers, including Aackosoft International B.V. for European markets and Comptiq for the Japanese MSX release.[^ref-2]

### Fan Projects

The game's enduring popularity led to an unofficial fan port for the Commodore PET/CBM in 2013, demonstrating continued interest in the title nearly three decades after its original release.[^ref-2] The game also inspired direct clones such as *Oilmania* (1991) for Atari ST, which players and reviewers openly acknowledged as an "Oil's Well clone."[^ref-21]

A modern remake was created by Firestorm Productions, updating the game with contemporary graphics while maintaining the original gameplay mechanics.[^ref-13]

### Critical Perspective

Oil's Well occupies an interesting position in Sierra On-Line's history as one of their more successful arcade-style games during a period when the company was primarily known for adventure titles. While it was openly derivative of the arcade game *Anteater*, the oil drilling re-theme gave it a distinct identity that resonated with players during the energy-conscious early 1980s.

The game's mechanics—extending a vulnerable "arm" through a maze while timing retractions to avoid enemies—created a unique tension not found in standard Pac-Man clones. As critics noted, the strategic element of route planning combined with reflexive timing requirements gave the game depth beyond simple dot-collection.[^ref-3] The 1990 remake demonstrated Sierra's willingness to revisit earlier successes with enhanced technology, though the updated version received more mixed reception than the nostalgically-remembered original.
