## Overview

Oil's Well (1990) is an arcade-style action game published by Sierra On-Line and developed by Banana Development, Inc. [^ref-1][^ref-2] The game serves as an enhanced remake of the original 1983 Oil's Well, which was designed by Thomas J. Mitchell for Atari 8-bit computers.[^ref-3][^ref-4] This updated version features 256-color VGA graphics, a full soundtrack composed by Ken Allen, and animated cartoon sequences between levels starring Slater the "Petrosaur."[^ref-1][^ref-5]

The gameplay concept draws inspiration from the 1982 arcade game Anteater, but re-themes the action around an oil drilling operation rather than a hungry insectivore.[^ref-3][^ref-6] Players guide a drilling bit through underground tunnels to collect dots of oil while avoiding subterranean creatures that can destroy the drilling apparatus.[^ref-1][^ref-7] The game has been described as "a fine cocktail of Dig-Dug, Snake, and Pac-Man elements stirred into a unique but fun and challenging game."[^ref-6]

While the original 1983 version became a solid commercial hit and won Computer Games Magazine's 1984 Golden Floppy Award for Maze Game of the Year[^ref-3][^ref-6], the 1990 remake arrived when customer expectations had significantly evolved.[^ref-6] Contemporary critics noted that "while the simple yet unique gameplay was plentiful for a commercial game in 1983, customers' expectations had changed significantly by 1990."[^ref-6]

## Story Summary

Oil's Well presents a straightforward arcade premise centered on resource extraction rather than a narrative-driven story.[^ref-7] Players take on the role of managing an oil drilling operation, extending a robotic mining arm deep below the earth's crust to collect valuable oil deposits.[^ref-7][^ref-8] The underground environment is populated with monstrous bugs and creatures that threaten the drilling operation at every turn.[^ref-7]

Between levels, players are treated to animated cartoon sequences featuring Slater the Petrosaur, a dinosaur character who finds himself frequently inconvenienced by a drillbit in various comedic situations.[^ref-1][^ref-5] These short movies provide entertainment rewards for completing each of the eight levels.[^ref-1] The final cartoon features a limousine with the words "Oils Well That Ends Well" – a pun that plays on the game's title, which itself is a play on the phrase "all's well."[^ref-5][^ref-3]

Slater proved popular enough as a character that he would later star in his own game, Slater & Charlie Go Camping.[^ref-5] This spin-off demonstrated that Sierra saw potential in the character beyond the Oil's Well franchise, though the dinosaur's fame ultimately remained modest compared to Sierra's flagship adventure game protagonists.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Oil's Well utilizes a simple yet challenging control scheme appropriate for its arcade-style gameplay.[^ref-7] Players use four directional controls to maneuver the drill head through the underground maze while a dedicated button allows for quick retraction of the drilling apparatus.[^ref-7] The 1990 DOS version supports both keyboard and mouse input methods.[^ref-5][^ref-9]

The player controls a drilling bit that leaves behind a pipeline as it moves through the underground tunnels.[^ref-3] This trailing pipe creates the core strategic challenge – the entire length of the drilling apparatus is vulnerable to enemy contact, not just the drill head itself.[^ref-3][^ref-7] One touch from the underground creatures to any part of the robotic arm results in losing a life.[^ref-7][^ref-8]

### Structure and Progression

The game features eight distinct levels that players must navigate through, with difficulty increasing progressively as players advance.[^ref-1][^ref-3] The three difficulty levels are uniquely named "Regular," "Unlimited," and "Premium" rather than using traditional easy/medium/hard designations.[^ref-8] After completing all eight levels, players can continue playing through additional challenges.[^ref-1]

- **Levels 1-8:** Core gameplay stages with increasing difficulty[^ref-1]
- **Beyond Level 8:** Extended gameplay for skilled players[^ref-1]
- **Cartoon Rewards:** Each completed level unlocks a short animated movie featuring Slater[^ref-1][^ref-5]

The game supports 1-2 players, allowing for competitive or alternating play sessions.[^ref-5][^ref-8]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The core mechanic involves navigating the drill head through pre-existing tunnel networks to collect all oil pellets scattered throughout each level.[^ref-9][^ref-10] The gameplay combines elements of maze navigation with the strategic considerations of managing an extending appendage – similar to the classic Snake game mechanic but with the added complexity of enemy avoidance.[^ref-6]

Players must carefully time their movements and plan their routes to avoid the various underground pests that patrol the tunnels.[^ref-1][^ref-3] The action is "well-paced" with "progressive difficulty," requiring good "eye-hand coordination, timing, and strategy" to succeed at higher levels.[^ref-3] Unlike many arcade games of the era, Oil's Well features an actual ending after completing all eight levels.[^ref-8]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

The original 1983 version of Oil's Well received considerable critical acclaim across multiple platforms. ANALOG Computing described it as a "truly different and challenging" variant on the traditional dot-collecting gameplay formula.[^ref-3] Dave Stone of Computer Gaming World noted that "the action's well-paced, the difficulty progressive. While getting to a higher level is somewhat dependent on getting the right breaks — good eye-hand coordination, timing, and strategy are essential."[^ref-3]

Ahoy! magazine found the "gameplay is, in my experience, unique" and gave it a "Recommended" rating.[^ref-3] InfoWorld called it "a clever, basic game,"[^ref-3] while InfoWorld's Essential Guide to Atari Computers labeled it "Sierra's trickiest."[^ref-3][^ref-4] In December 1983, InfoWorld magazine gave Oil's Well the edge over competing title Ardy the Aardvark for its "super-fast gameplay."[^ref-6]

The 1990 remake received more mixed reception. MobyGames user reviews noted that the "soundtrack is brilliantly composed by Ken Allen, and blends in with the game's overall theme."[^ref-5] However, some reviewers questioned Sierra's decision to remake this particular title, with one noting "I don't know why Sierra chose Oil's Well to make a remake of and not something else."[^ref-5] Home of the Underdogs described it as "a fun little clone of classic Digger" that is "fast, fun, but somehow missing the longevity that makes Digger a classic."[^ref-11]

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospective assessments generally favor the original over the remake. Home of the Underdogs stated that "the 1990 remake version is much better" than the original, though they noted it remained "good for nostalgia, but little else."[^ref-11] Retrospective analysis concluded that "while the 1990 release of Oil's Well is cute and enjoyable, the original version is the better of the two."[^ref-6]

User reviews on abandonware sites have been notably harsh, with one reviewer calling the game "frustrating, annoying, and lame, even by 1990s standards."[^ref-9] The game was characterized as an "addictive arcade game where you control a robotic arm trying to mine oil in the underground tunnels."[^ref-5]

## Development

### Origins

Oil's Well began as an original creation by programmer Thomas J. Mitchell for Atari 8-bit computers in 1983.[^ref-3][^ref-4] The game concept was similar to Chris Oberth's Anteater/Ardy the Aardvark arcade games from 1982, but Mitchell swapped the anthill setting for an oil-drilling operation theme.[^ref-6][^ref-3] This re-theming gave the game its own identity while maintaining the core gameplay mechanic of controlling an extending appendage through a maze-like environment.[^ref-6]

The original game was released under Sierra's short-lived "SierraVision" label before being re-released in 1984 under the generic Sierra label.[^ref-6] The game proved successful enough to warrant ports to multiple platforms including Apple II (programmed by Ivan Strand), Commodore 64, ColecoVision (programmed by Don McGlauflin), IBM PC, MSX, and Sharp X1.[^ref-3][^ref-6][^ref-8]

### Production

The 1990 remake came about after Sierra discovered Banana Development through their game Bananoid.[^ref-6] Sierra contracted Banana Development to create an enhanced version of Oil's Well featuring improved visuals and sound for the DOS platform.[^ref-6][^ref-1] Notably, the remake was produced without the involvement of original creator Thomas J. Mitchell.[^ref-3]

The enhanced graphics were created by Nancy Hoffelmeyer (Art Director) and Andy Hoyos (Assistant Art Director), both of whom also worked on King's Quest V.[^ref-6][^ref-5] This connection to Sierra's flagship adventure series brought high production values to the remake's visual presentation. The programming for the IBM version was handled by William Rieder.[^ref-5]

### Technical Achievements

The 1990 remake featured significant technical improvements over the original versions.[^ref-6] The game showcased 256-color VGA graphics, a substantial upgrade from the limited color palettes of the 1983 releases.[^ref-6][^ref-12] Ken Allen composed an original soundtrack that reviewers praised as "brilliantly composed" and well-suited to the game's theme.[^ref-5]

One of the most notable additions was the inclusion of animated cartoon sequences between levels.[^ref-6][^ref-5] These featured Slater the Petrosaur in various comedic situations involving drillbits, providing entertainment incentives for level completion beyond simple score advancement.[^ref-1][^ref-5]

### Technical Issues

Users have reported several compatibility issues with the 1990 DOS version:[^ref-9][^ref-13]

- **Control Mapping Issues:** Some DOSBox configurations result in mouse controls instead of the expected arrow keys and spacebar, significantly altering gameplay[^ref-9]
- **Version Confusion:** Download sites have occasionally provided the 1984 CGA version instead of the 1990 VGA remake[^ref-9]
- **Vintage Hardware Compatibility:** Testing on NEC Mobile Gear MC-MK12 showed the 1990 version runs but lacks keyboard input functionality[^ref-13]

- **Final Cartoon:** The last animated sequence features a limousine with the words "Oils Well That Ends Well"[^ref-5]
- **Debug Mode:** A debug mode can be activated by creating a file named BETA.DAT containing the string "Taito SoftwareOW" – pressing F8 grants invincibility while F7 allows skipping levels[^ref-14]
- **Developer Connections:** Bill Sargent, who worked on the original 1983 version, went on to work on The Sims and SimCity 2000[^ref-7]
- **Difficulty Naming:** The three difficulty levels are humorously named "Regular," "Unlimited," and "Premium" – referencing gasoline grades[^ref-8]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

The original 1983 Oil's Well "managed to do what Anteater couldn't and became a solid hit."[^ref-6] The game's success earned it Computer Games Magazine's 1984 Golden Floppy Award for Excellence in the Maze Game of the Year category.[^ref-3][^ref-6] This recognition cemented the game's status as one of the standout arcade-style games of its era.

The 1990 remake represented Sierra's attempt to capitalize on the nostalgia for classic arcade games during the VGA graphics era, though critical reception suggested the updated version struggled to justify its existence in a marketplace with significantly higher expectations for gameplay depth.[^ref-6]

### Collections

Oil's Well (1990) was included in the compilation **Action Five** released in 1992.[^ref-5] This bundle package allowed Sierra to extend the commercial life of the remake by combining it with other action-oriented titles from their catalog.

The game is currently preserved and playable through the Internet Archive's DOS game collection, which hosts thousands of classic games through browser-based DOSBox emulation.[^ref-1]

### Fan Projects

An unofficial conversion of Oil's Well appeared in 2013, continuing the legacy of this classic arcade title.[^ref-8] The game's simple but engaging mechanics have made it a candidate for recreation by hobbyist programmers interested in preserving classic gameplay experiences.

### Critical Perspective

Oil's Well occupies an interesting position in Sierra's catalog as one of their purely arcade-style offerings during an era when the company was primarily known for adventure games. The original 1983 version demonstrated that Sierra could successfully compete in the action game market, offering what critics called "truly different and challenging" gameplay that combined familiar elements in novel ways.[^ref-3]

The 1990 remake illustrates the challenges of updating classic arcade games for modern audiences. While the technical improvements – VGA graphics, Ken Allen's soundtrack, and animated interludes – were substantial, the fundamental gameplay remained rooted in early 1980s design sensibilities.[^ref-6] This disconnect between presentation and gameplay depth led some critics to question whether the remake was necessary, though the charming Slater character proved memorable enough to spawn his own game.[^ref-5][^ref-6]

As an historical artifact, Oil's Well represents Sierra's diverse publishing strategy during their golden era, demonstrating their willingness to maintain and update their back catalog even as they pushed forward with groundbreaking adventure games like King's Quest V and Space Quest IV.
