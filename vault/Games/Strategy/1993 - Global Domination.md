## Overview

Global Domination is a turn-based strategy game developed and published by [[Impressions Games]] in 1993 for DOS and Amiga platforms[^ref-1][^ref-4]. The game is modeled closely on the classic board game Risk, expanding upon that foundation with additional territories, unit types, intelligence operations, and unit obsolescence mechanics[^ref-3]. Set in a near-future world divided into five power nations fighting for complete planetary control, players employ tactics, spying, and diplomacy to achieve global conquest[^ref-4].

Designed by [[Simon Bradbury]] and [[David Lester]], Global Domination represents Impressions Games' entry into the strategic conquest genre during the early 1990s[^ref-1]. The game was released under the alternate title "Stratagem" in the European market[^ref-5]. Despite mixed reception, contemporary reviewers praised it as "a simple, workmanlike, intermediate-level, conquer-the-world game that's surprisingly enjoyable and addictive"[^ref-3], while noting it served as "a great solitaire game with high replay value"[^ref-6].

## Story Summary

In the near-future, the world has become divided into five power nations engaged in a desperate struggle for complete control of the planet[^ref-4]. These superpowers marshal their forces, deploy intelligence operations, and wage diplomatic warfare in pursuit of total domination. The narrative premise establishes that smaller powers exist between these great nations, waiting to fall under the control of whichever superpower can assert dominance over their territories[^ref-4].

The game employs a science fiction conceit wherein historical leaders have been cloned using advanced DNA retrieval techniques, allowing players to face off against legendary military strategists and conquerors from throughout human history[^ref-8]. These AI opponents include figures such as Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, Queen Victoria, Otto von Bismarck, Abraham Lincoln, General Custer, Genghis Khan, and Henry V[^ref-9][^ref-3]. The ultimate goal, as the game's description notes, is achieving peace—but only when you emerge as "the only one leader on the world"[^ref-4].

Four distinct historical scenarios provide different starting configurations: 1914 (the eve of World War I), 1939 (the beginning of World War II), 1995 (contemporary setting), and a post-apocalyptic 2500 scenario that envisions humanity's fractured future[^ref-3]. Each scenario alters the geopolitical landscape and available technologies, creating varied strategic challenges.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Global Domination utilizes a top-down graphical interface with keyboard and mouse input support[^ref-7]. The game presents a world map divided into numerous territories, significantly expanding upon the original Risk board game's territory count[^ref-3]. Players interact through menus to manage their forces, conduct diplomacy, and order intelligence operations. The multiplayer functionality supports modem connections for remote play[^ref-7].

### Structure and Progression

The game offers three complexity levels to accommodate different player skill levels: Simple, Reduced, and Full[^ref-8]. Players can engage in matches with up to four human participants or compete against AI opponents representing the cloned historical leaders[^ref-8].

**Available Scenarios:**
- **1914:** Pre-World War I configuration with period-appropriate technologies
- **1939:** World War II era starting positions
- **1995:** Contemporary geopolitical arrangement
- **2500:** Post-apocalyptic future scenario[^ref-3]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Unlike pure Risk, Global Domination incorporates multiple strategic systems beyond simple territorial conquest[^ref-3]. Players must manage various unit types with different capabilities and consider unit obsolescence as technology advances through different eras[^ref-3]. Intelligence operations allow for covert activities including espionage, sabotage, and information gathering about enemy positions and capabilities[^ref-3].

Mini-game combat sequences resolve territorial battles, adding an action element to the strategic layer[^ref-6]. Revolution mechanics can trigger within controlled territories, forcing players to maintain stability in their conquered regions[^ref-10]. One reviewer described the experience as "a hybrid of Risk and Civilization," indicating the game's ambition to blend multiple strategy subgenres[^ref-10].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Computer Gaming World's Chuck Moss reviewed Global Domination in February 1994, giving the game a "Thumbs Up" recommendation[^ref-3]. Moss characterized it as "at once both a failure and a surprising success," acknowledging the game's limitations while praising its addictive qualities[^ref-6]. He specifically highlighted the single-player experience, calling it "a great solitaire game with high replay value"[^ref-6].

The game received mixed assessments from various publications. Critics appreciated the expanded strategic depth compared to basic Risk adaptations but noted interface issues and control problems[^ref-11]. One contemporary review stated bluntly that "everything that could have went wrong with this game did," pointing to scattered interfaces and unresponsive controls[^ref-11].

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospectives continue to view Global Domination with mixed feelings. A MobyGames user review from PCGamer77 in March 2002 concluded that "Global Domination isn't a terrible game, but it isn't good either," noting that "a laundry list of features does not a good wargame make"[^ref-12][^ref-7]. The same review revealed that while Hitler was advertised as an AI opponent, he was not included in the final game, suggesting the designers were concerned about political correctness[^ref-12].

Home of the Underdogs (HOTUD) described Global Domination as "an awful multiplayer real-time game of world conquest that is bogged down by very confusing interface and boring display of bland statistics"[^ref-10]. However, other retrospective assessments have been more charitable, with one user comparing it favorably to "a hybrid of Risk and Civilization"[^ref-10].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames Critics:** 77% average[^ref-7]
- **Abandonware DOS:** 3.80/5.00[^ref-1]
- **MyAbandonware:** 4.08/5[^ref-10]

## Development

### Origins

Global Domination was developed by Impressions Games, a studio known for historical simulation and strategy titles[^ref-1]. The game emerged from a desire to create a more sophisticated version of Risk-style global conquest gameplay, incorporating elements from more complex wargames and civilization-building titles[^ref-3]. Designers Simon Bradbury and David Lester conceived the project to bridge the gap between casual board game adaptations and hardcore strategy simulations[^ref-1].

### Production

The development team at Impressions Games worked to expand the basic Risk formula with numerous additional systems[^ref-3]. The inclusion of cloned historical leaders as AI opponents required programming distinct personality traits and strategic tendencies for each character[^ref-8]. Christopher J. Denman composed the game's music, creating original tracks including a memorable Select Players Screen theme that plays in 3/4 time signature, resembling a waltz[^ref-9].

### Technical Achievements

The game utilized the AIL / Miles Sound System engine for audio playback[^ref-7]. Music was rendered through OPL3 FM synthesis on Sound Blaster cards, providing period-appropriate audio quality[^ref-9]. The multiplayer implementation supported modem connections, allowing remote players to compete in an era before widespread internet gaming[^ref-7].

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- Hitler was advertised as an AI opponent in promotional materials but was ultimately excluded from the final game, likely due to political sensitivity concerns[^ref-12]
- The Select Players Screen music is composed in 3/4 time, giving it a distinctive waltz-like quality that one blogger described as "so catchy I often find myself whistling the theme while I work"[^ref-9]
- The game's music was recorded and preserved through DOSBox emulation of OPL3 FM synthesis chips[^ref-9]
- AI opponents include playable characters based on: Abraham Lincoln, Queen Victoria, Otto von Bismarck, Napoleon Bonaparte, "The Caveman," General Custer, Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan, and Henry V[^ref-9]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Global Domination achieved modest commercial success, maintaining enough interest to appear on abandonware sites and collector wishlists decades after release[^ref-14]. The game has been preserved through various abandonware archives and remains playable through DOSBox emulation[^ref-4][^ref-10]. Used copies have sold for approximately $15.00 in the secondary market[^ref-12].

### Collections

The game has not appeared in any official Sierra or Impressions compilations. However, it remains available through abandonware distribution sites including MyAbandonware[^ref-10], Abandonware DOS[^ref-1], and ClassicReload[^ref-15]. The Internet Archive maintains a playable browser version for preservation purposes[^ref-4][^ref-13].

### Fan Projects

Community interest in Global Domination has remained modest but persistent. The game has a dedicated wishlist page on GOG.com, where fans have requested an official re-release[^ref-14]. One fan noted creating the Wikipedia article for the game, expressing surprise years later upon rediscovering their contribution: "And I can't believe that the wikipedia article there was created by yours truly - mind blown (I actually forgot about ever creating it)"[^ref-14].

### Related Publications

- **Game Manual:** Original user manual included with Commodore Amiga release, detailing game mechanics, scenarios, and AI opponent personalities[^ref-8]

### Critical Perspective

Global Domination occupies an interesting position in strategy gaming history as an ambitious but flawed attempt to evolve the Risk formula. The game's designers clearly understood the limitations of pure territorial conquest gameplay and attempted to address them through additional systems including intelligence operations, unit variety, and technological progression[^ref-3]. However, the execution proved inconsistent, with interface problems undermining the strategic depth[^ref-11][^ref-12].

The inclusion of historical leaders as AI opponents anticipated later games that would similarly blend historical figures with strategic gameplay. The game's mixed reception reflects the challenges of adapting beloved board games to digital formats—a challenge that would persist through numerous Risk adaptations in subsequent decades. Despite its shortcomings, Global Domination's "surprisingly enjoyable and addictive" qualities[^ref-3] earned it a dedicated cult following among strategy enthusiasts.

## See Also

Global Domination builds upon the strategic foundations laid by its predecessor, V for Victory - D-Day Utah Beach, by expanding the scope of conflict to a global scale and introducing new mechanics such as intelligence operations and unit obsolescence. This shift towards a more complex and dynamic world reflects the evolving nature of strategy games in the early 1990s, with Global Domination offering players a chance to engage in diplomatic warfare and manage multiple unit types across various territories. The game's science fiction conceit, which involves cloned historical leaders, adds a unique twist to the traditional strategy formula.

In terms of narrative continuity, Global Domination's focus on global conquest and the struggle for power among five superpowers sets the stage for the more futuristic and otherworldly conflicts that would be explored in the next entry in the series, Alien Legacy. The game's emphasis on strategic decision-making and resource management also lays the groundwork for the more complex and nuanced gameplay mechanics that would be introduced in Alien Legacy. Furthermore, the inclusion of historical scenarios and figures in Global Domination provides a sense of depth and context that would be built upon in subsequent games.

The mechanical evolution from V for Victory - D-Day Utah Beach to Global Domination is also noteworthy, as the latter game introduces new features such as mini-game combat sequences and revolution mechanics. These additions enhance the gameplay experience and provide players with more options for strategic expression, setting a precedent for the innovative and engaging gameplay that would be found in Alien Legacy. Overall, Global Domination serves as a key transitional point in the series, bridging the gap between the more focused and historical conflicts of V for Victory - D-Day Utah Beach and the more expansive and futuristic struggles of Alien Legacy.
