 Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom is a city-building strategy game developed by BreakAway Games in collaboration with [[Impressions Games]] and published by [[Sierra On-Line|Sierra Entertainment]] in September 2002[^ref-1]. The sixth and final entry in Sierra's acclaimed City Building Series, Emperor transported players to ancient China, spanning nearly 3,300 years of classical Chinese history from the Xia Dynasty (2033 BCE) to the Song-Jin Dynasties (1234 CE)[^ref-1]. The game represented both a culmination of the series' established mechanics and a thematic departure, being the first title to move outside of European and Northern African settings[^ref-2].

The game challenges players to construct and manage Chinese cities through seven imperial dynasties, balancing economic development, monument construction, military defense, and diplomatic relations[^ref-3]. Emperor introduced several innovations to the series, including the feng shui system for harmonious city planning, the Chinese zodiac for company naming, and—for the first time in the franchise—multiplayer support with both cooperative and competitive modes[^ref-1]. Despite being the last game to use the series' traditional 2D-sprite engine before Caesar IV's transition to 3D, Emperor is widely regarded by fans as the pinnacle of the City Building formula[^ref-4].

## Story Summary

Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom does not follow a traditional narrative but instead guides players through the historical progression of Chinese civilization across seven dynastic campaigns[^ref-9]. Beginning with the semi-legendary Xia Dynasty around 2100 BCE, players witness the dawn of Chinese urban development, learning the fundamental mechanics of city construction through tutorial missions set in this formative era[^ref-7].

The campaigns progress chronologically through the Shang, Zhou, Qin, Han, Sui-Tang, and Song-Jin dynasties, each presenting unique economic, military, and diplomatic challenges reflective of their historical periods[^ref-1]. Players may tackle these dynasties in any order they choose, though the difficulty level increases parallel to the chronology[^ref-1]. Throughout these campaigns, players encounter historical figures, construct famous monuments including the Great Wall of China, Grand Canal, and Su Song's clock tower, and navigate the complex political landscape of ancient China[^ref-8].

The game's narrative framework emphasizes the Mandate of Heaven concept central to Chinese political philosophy—rulers who fail to govern wisely and maintain harmony may face natural disasters, rebellions, and the end of their reign[^ref-9]. Players must honor ancestors, maintain proper feng shui in their city layouts, and balance the needs of common citizens with the demands of the elite to ensure prosperity[^ref-7]. The final campaigns depict the Song-Jin period, concluding just before the Mongol invasion, with the game presenting an alternate history where "the Jin Dynasty thwarted the Mongol invasion and defeated Genghis Khan"[^ref-8].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Emperor utilizes an isometric 2D perspective with a fixed viewing angle, building upon the interface refined through earlier titles in the City Building Series[^ref-10]. Players construct cities on a fixed grid system, placing buildings, roads, and agricultural infrastructure to create functional urban centers[^ref-10]. The game retains the walker-based system that defined the series, where service workers emanate from buildings and wander along roads to deliver goods and services to residences[^ref-11].

The interface includes multiple ministries for managing different aspects of city administration, including Agriculture, Industry, Commerce, Safety, Government, Entertainment, Religion, and Military[^ref-9]. Players can adjust tax rates, set trade policies, and manage diplomatic relations with neighboring cities through intuitive menu systems[^ref-7]. A significant quality-of-life improvement allows players to deactivate buildings individually, providing more precise control over city operations[^ref-12].

### Structure and Progression

The game features over 40 scenarios organized into seven dynastic campaigns, each representing a distinct period of Chinese history[^ref-13]:

- **Xia Dynasty (Tutorial):** Introduction to basic city-building mechanics in prehistoric China, cultivating millet and establishing fundamental infrastructure[^ref-11]
- **Shang Dynasty:** Development of bronze working and early Chinese civilization
- **Zhou Dynasty:** Expansion of agriculture and introduction of iron
- **Qin Dynasty:** Military conquest and construction of early Great Wall sections
- **Han Dynasty:** Trade route establishment and cultural flourishing
- **Sui-Tang Dynasty:** Grand engineering projects and cosmopolitan urban development
- **Song-Jin Dynasty:** Advanced technology and defense against northern invaders

Each mission presents specific victory conditions, which may include reaching target populations, producing certain quantities of commodities, accumulating treasury funds, conquering neighboring cities, or constructing monuments[^ref-14]. Players can also engage in Open Play mode, allowing unrestricted city construction without specific objectives[^ref-15].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The core gameplay revolves around managing the complex interdependencies between housing, industry, agriculture, and services[^ref-16]. Housing evolves through multiple tiers based on access to goods and services, from simple hovels to luxurious apartments that provide additional workers and tax revenue[^ref-9]. Common houses occupy 2x2 tiles while elite housing requires 4x4 spaces, each with distinct requirements for goods such as hemp, silk, ceramics, bronzeware, lacquerware, and tea[^ref-12].

The feng shui system represents Emperor's most distinctive mechanical innovation[^ref-12]. Building footprints display green or yellow coloring based on their harmony rating with surrounding structures, affecting worker efficiency and housing desirability. Players must consider the auspicious placement of buildings to maximize city productivity[^ref-7]. The Chinese zodiac influences gameplay through company naming conventions featuring combinations like "Audacious Rabbits" or "Celestial Rats"[^ref-8].

Agriculture incorporates three climatic regions—arid, temperate, and humid—each supporting different crop types including rice, millet, wheat, and various vegetables[^ref-17]. Food quality mechanics require players to provide diverse diets to satisfy higher-tier housing[^ref-9]. Military elements allow players to train armies and launch attacks on rival cities, though combat remains secondary to city management[^ref-18].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom received generally favorable reviews upon release, with critics praising its refined city-building mechanics while noting the lack of significant innovation from previous entries[^ref-19]. Game Informer awarded the game 9.25/10, calling it "another great city-builder from a developer that has come to define a niche genre all its own"[^ref-1]. GameZone's Michael Lafferty gave it 9.3/10, describing it as "a gorgeous, challenging and thoroughly enjoyable civilization game"[^ref-20].

IGN's Dan Adams scored the game 8.8/10, praising the Chinese setting while acknowledging familiarity: "While Emperor is a quality game, and therefore deserving of the score, it's virtually the same game that we've seen before"[^ref-2]. He concluded that newcomers would be "silly not to" try the game, while veterans would find "more of what they want"[^ref-2]. GameSpy's William Abner similarly noted: "Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom is not an innovative game. It's not all that new and not all that different from the other games in Sierra's classic 'City Building' franchise—but it's loads of fun all the same"[^ref-13].

GameSpot's Ron Dulin provided a more critical assessment at 7.7/10, arguing that "if Zeus was two steps forward for the series, Emperor is its one step back"[^ref-14]. He praised the addictive formula while criticizing the cumbersome combat interface and aimless wandering of workers[^ref-14]. PC Gamer's Stephen Poole awarded 72%, noting the game "offers more of the same good stuff, but no real creative innovation" and criticized the AI: "instead of AI, you get an automated spreadsheet"[^ref-21].

The Electric Playground's Jules Grant gave 7.5/10, emphasizing the series' historical atmosphere as its defining strength while cautioning players against expecting robust military gameplay: "Please, though, don't go bringing your conquering, war-mongering ambitions to this game, for although they talk of invading other cities on the box cover, that is not the strength of Emperor"[^ref-22].

### Modern Assessment

Emperor has experienced significant reappraisal in the years following its release, with many players and critics now considering it the finest entry in the City Building Series. Rock Paper Shotgun declared that "Emperor was by far the better game, and is arguably as good as historical city builders ever got"[^ref-23]. TheGamer's Meg Pelliccio, discovering the game 21 years after release, proclaimed: "Emperor is the best game in the entire series and I was a fool for not knowing about it sooner"[^ref-24].

The game's re-release on GOG.com in February 2017 introduced it to new audiences, where it maintains an impressive 4.7/5 rating from 258 user reviews[^ref-4]. One verified owner described it as "the pinnacle of the series" and "the best game with the Caesar III engine"[^ref-4]. The 20th anniversary in 2022 was celebrated by the active fan community at Emperor Heaven, demonstrating the game's enduring appeal[^ref-25].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **Metacritic:** 77/100 (based on 15 critic reviews)[^ref-19]
- **GOG.com:** 4.7/5 (258 user reviews)[^ref-4]
- **HowLongToBeat:** 79% recommendation[^ref-26]
- **IMDb:** 7.1/10 (18 ratings)[^ref-27]

## Development

### Origins

Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom emerged from Sierra's successful City Building Series, which had previously explored ancient Rome (Caesar III), Egypt (Pharaoh), and Greece (Zeus: Master of Olympus)[^ref-14]. The decision to set the game in ancient China represented the first time the series ventured outside European and Northern African civilizations[^ref-2]. As the game manual noted, "China is the oldest continuous civilization in the world, with nearly 4,000 years of history" and "one in five people on earth live in China, and it has been this way for at least a thousand years"[^ref-17].

BreakAway Games was contracted to develop Emperor after having previously worked on the Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile expansion for Pharaoh and the Paradise Island add-on for Tropico[^ref-1][^ref-14]. This represented a significant transition, as Impressions Games had been the core developer for the series since its inception[^ref-13]. The development team strived to "keep things according to true historical facts as much as possible"[^ref-15].

### Production

The development built upon the Zeus: Master of Olympus game engine, retaining the 2D-sprite graphics that had defined the series while implementing China-specific features[^ref-5]. Buildings were designed 25% larger than in previous games, providing more visual detail[^ref-15]. The team created nearly 80 distinct structures including various farm types for different crops and climatic regions[^ref-21].

The addition of multiplayer represented a significant technical undertaking, supporting up to eight players online via Sierra's gaming system, direct IP connection, or LAN[^ref-15]. Multiplayer games were designed to take approximately 90 minutes, with both competitive and cooperative modes available[^ref-28]. The development team also created a Campaign Creator tool, allowing players to design custom missions and share them with the community[^ref-29].

**Development Credits:**[^ref-1]
- **Designers:** Charles Kibler, Ed Beach, Tony Leier
- **Composer:** Jeff van Dyck

### Technical Achievements

Emperor represented the final evolution of the 2D-sprite engine that had powered the City Building Series since Caesar III[^ref-1]. Rather than pursuing 3D graphics, which would later be implemented in Caesar IV, the team focused on maximizing the visual appeal of the isometric perspective. As GameWatcher noted, "The '3D acceleration makes a great game' rule just simply doesn't apply here. Emperor's graphics are vivid, colorful and eye catching"[^ref-15].

The feng shui system required sophisticated pathfinding and building-relationship calculations to determine harmony values in real-time[^ref-12]. The game's support for multiple food types and quality levels added complexity to the economic simulation[^ref-12]. Jeff van Dyck composed the soundtrack, incorporating traditional Chinese instruments and melodic structures that reviewers described as "absolutely great" and contributing to a "zen-like" atmosphere[^ref-15][^ref-12].

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

Emperor contains several humorous touches that reward attentive players:

- **Citizen Commentary:** Right-clicking on citizens produces funny audio clips commenting on the player's management decisions[^ref-15]
- **Uncle Sam Cheat:** Entering "Uncle Sam" causes tax collectors to transform into Uncle Sam characters[^ref-33]
- **Lizardman Cheat:** The "Lizardman" code transforms the player's hero into a giant lizard[^ref-33]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

While specific sales figures were not documented in the available research, Emperor represented the culmination of Sierra's City Building Series before the transition to 3D with Caesar IV. The game's continued availability on GOG.com and active modding community demonstrate its lasting commercial appeal. As PC Gamer noted, "Like its predecessors, it'll ensure a profit margin for Sierra on very little investment"[^ref-21].

### Collections

Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom was re-released through several channels:
- **GOG.com:** Digital release in February 2017[^ref-4]
- **Sold Out Software:** Budget European release[^ref-30]
- **Sierra Bestseller Series:** European budget re-releases in multiple languages including German and Slovene[^ref-34]

### Fan Projects

The game maintains an active fan community centered around Emperor Heaven (emperor.heavengames.com), which hosts custom campaigns, patches, and modding resources[^ref-25]. Notable community contributions include:

- **Emperor Resolution Customiser:** Enables widescreen support and custom resolutions[^ref-31]
- **EmperorLimitPatch:** Removes building limits, allowing construction of larger cities[^ref-35]
- **Custom Campaigns:** Fan-designed missions including "Pirate Limahong" campaign by frut_mut[^ref-25]

The 20th anniversary in 2022 saw renewed interest and new custom content creation[^ref-25].

### Related Publications

- **Campaign Creator User's Guide:** PDF documentation for creating custom missions[^ref-29]
- **Quick Reference Card:** Included with physical releases[^ref-34]

### Critical Perspective

Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom occupies a unique position in city-building game history as both the culmination of an established formula and an underappreciated gem that many players discovered only years after release. While contemporary critics praised its solid mechanics and atmospheric setting, they frequently noted the lack of innovation from previous entries—a criticism that has softened considerably with time as the genre has moved in different directions.

The game's enduring appeal stems from its refined implementation of the walker-based city-building system, its distinctive feng shui mechanics, and its immersive recreation of ancient Chinese civilization. Modern retrospectives consistently identify it as the peak of the City Building Series, with the subsequent 3D transition in Caesar IV viewed less favorably by series veterans[^ref-10]. Emperor represents "arguably as good as historical city builders ever got"[^ref-23], serving as a benchmark against which newer entries in the genre are measured.

The game also holds significance as the final 2D entry in the series and the last major release from Impressions Games before the studio's closure the following year[^ref-5]. Its availability on GOG.com has introduced it to new generations of players, many of whom share Meg Pelliccio's sentiment of wondering how they missed such an exceptional game for so long[^ref-24].

Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom is the sixth and final title in Sierra's City Building Series, following the progression from ancient Rome through Egypt and Greece to China. While each game stands independently with its own historical setting, they share core mechanics including the walker-based service system, housing evolution tiers, monument construction, and economic management. Emperor represents the most refined implementation of the 2D engine before the series transitioned to 3D graphics with Caesar IV in 2006.

BreakAway Games' involvement continued the collaborative development approach established with the Cleopatra expansion for Pharaoh, demonstrating Sierra's practice of partnering with external studios to expand the franchise[^ref-1]. The game's multiplayer introduction represented a significant step forward for the genre, though the feature saw limited adoption and servers are no longer available[^ref-15].
