## Overview

WW2 Air Force Commander is a turn-based war strategy game released in 1993 by [[Impressions Games]], serving as a direct follow-up to the original Air Force Commander (1992)[^ref-1][^ref-2]. Set during World War II, the game allows players to choose between several historical scenarios, engaging in strategic aerial combat between the Allies and the Axis powers[^ref-3]. The game stands out as a turn-based wargame dedicated to a relatively uncommon subject for such games: leadership of almost exclusively air force operations[^ref-4].

The game invites players to "Reach for the Sky with this Epic World War 2 Air Warfare Simulation," offering a comprehensive strategic experience that includes managing resources, bases, pilots, and aircraft across 28 historic WWII scenarios[^ref-5]. Unlike the modern-day Middle Eastern setting of its predecessor, WW2 Air Force Commander focuses entirely on air combat during the Second World War, with gameplay beginning in 1940 during the German attack on Norway[^ref-4]. Players can choose to command either the Allied forces or Germany, experiencing the air war from both perspectives[^ref-4].

Developed during a period when flight simulators and war strategy games were gaining popularity, WW2 Air Force Commander represented Impressions Games' continued exploration of aerial warfare themes[^ref-6]. The game was released for both DOS and Amiga platforms, making it accessible to a broad range of PC gamers of the early 1990s[^ref-1][^ref-7].

## Story Summary

WW2 Air Force Commander places players in the role of an air force commander during World War II, tasked with leading aerial operations across various historical theaters of the conflict[^ref-3]. The game opens with scenarios set during the German attack on Norway in 1940, immediately thrusting players into the early stages of the European air war[^ref-4].

The narrative framework encompasses the major aerial campaigns of World War II, allowing players to experience pivotal moments from the conflict[^ref-3]. Players must strategically engage in combat between the Allies and the Axis powers, recreating or altering historical outcomes through their tactical decisions[^ref-1]. The game features both sides of the conflict, enabling players to take command as either the defending Allied forces or the aggressive German Luftwaffe[^ref-4].

Throughout the various scenarios, players encounter the full spectrum of WWII air operations, from defensive missions protecting strategic assets to offensive bombing campaigns against enemy positions[^ref-6]. The game captures the tension and demands of wartime command, where every decision carries significant weight for the outcome of the conflict[^ref-6].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

WW2 Air Force Commander utilizes a top-down perspective for its strategic gameplay, typical of war strategy games of the early 1990s[^ref-8][^ref-9]. The game supports both keyboard and mouse input, with a Microsoft-compatible mouse recommended for optimal control[^ref-5][^ref-1]. The interface allows players to manage their air force assets, issue commands to squadrons, and monitor the strategic situation across the battlefield.

The game features a turn-based system that distinguishes it from real-time flight simulators of the era[^ref-4]. This approach allows players to carefully consider their strategic options without the pressure of real-time decision-making, making it accessible to strategy enthusiasts who prefer methodical gameplay over twitch reflexes.

### Structure and Progression

The game offers 28 historic WWII scenarios that players can engage with, providing substantial variety in terms of strategic challenges and historical contexts[^ref-5]. Gameplay progression involves:

- **Scenario Selection:** Players choose from multiple historical scenarios representing different theaters and phases of the air war[^ref-3]
- **Force Selection:** The option to play as either the Allies or Axis powers[^ref-4]
- **Resource Management:** Managing bases, pilots, and aircraft throughout campaigns[^ref-3]
- **Strategic Combat:** Engaging enemy forces through tactical air operations[^ref-3]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

As a war strategy game, WW2 Air Force Commander focuses on tactical decision-making rather than traditional puzzle-solving[^ref-3]. Core mechanics include:

**Air Force Management:** Players must carefully manage their resources, including bases, pilots, and various aircraft types such as bombers and fighters[^ref-3][^ref-4]. Effective resource allocation is crucial to success in the game's various scenarios.

**Combat Operations:** The gameplay encompasses a variety of mission types including fighter operations, bombing runs, escort missions, and dogfights[^ref-6]. Players must also manage practical concerns such as fuel and ammunition during operations[^ref-6].

**Strategic Decision-Making:** The pacing of combat scenarios is described as relentless, with enemy fighters appearing without warning and flak filling the sky around bombing targets[^ref-6]. This creates tense situations that demand careful tactical planning and situational awareness[^ref-6].

**Two-Player Mode:** The game supports up to two players, allowing for head-to-head strategic competition[^ref-1].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Contemporary reviews of WW2 Air Force Commander were mixed, reflecting the challenges faced by many of Impressions Games' early titles. The original Air Force Commander, upon which WW2 Air Force Commander was built, received criticism for its "weak AI and cumbersome user interface that characterize most of Impressions' early efforts," leading one reviewer to describe it as "a marginal underdog at best"[^ref-9].

The predecessor Air Force Commander was noted for having detailed and somewhat esoteric scenarios, though critics pointed out that "the speed of the game could not be slowed down," a technical issue that required a patch distributed over electronic bulletin boards[^ref-9]. The overall assessment characterized the original as "an interesting effort with little potential for enduring play value"[^ref-9].

### Modern Assessment

Modern abandonware and retro gaming sites have provided more favorable retrospective assessments of WW2 Air Force Commander. The game is recognized as an interesting entry in the genre, particularly for fans of combat games and aerial warfare simulations[^ref-8].

Free Game Empire notes that "if you are a big fan of combat games and wish to fight in the air, then this game is basically made a must try for you"[^ref-8]. The site positions the game as fitting "into a period when flight simulators were gaining complexity but still relied heavily on player imagination and straightforward mechanics"[^ref-6].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** 3.7/5[^ref-1]
- **My Abandonware:** 4.38/5[^ref-10]
- **Play Old Games:** 5.0/5[^ref-4]
- **Free Game Empire:** 4/5[^ref-8]

## Development

### Origins

WW2 Air Force Commander was developed as a direct follow-up to the original Air Force Commander, which was released in 1992[^ref-1][^ref-9]. While the original game focused on modern air combat scenarios in the Middle East[^ref-9], the sequel shifted the setting to the more popular and commercially appealing World War II theater[^ref-3].

Impressions Games, originally known as Impressions Software or Impression Software, was founded in 1989 with a focus on strategy and business games, including sport simulations[^ref-8]. The company would later be acquired by Sierra On-Line in 1995[^ref-8], bringing the Air Force Commander series under the Sierra family umbrella.

### Production

The development of WW2 Air Force Commander built upon the foundation established by the original Air Force Commander. The game engine used for Air Force Commander was later improved and utilized for other Impressions titles including Global Domination and When Two Worlds War[^ref-9], indicating a shared technological heritage among these strategy games.

The Amiga version of the original Air Force Commander was developed by Golden Sector[^ref-9][^ref-11], suggesting a similar collaborative approach may have been used for the WW2 sequel's multi-platform release.

### Technical Achievements

WW2 Air Force Commander represented the continued evolution of Impressions Games' strategy game engine. The top-down perspective allowed for clear visualization of strategic situations while the turn-based system enabled complex decision-making without real-time pressure[^ref-4][^ref-8].

The game's 28 historic scenarios demonstrated ambitious scope for a strategy title of its era[^ref-5], providing players with substantial content to explore across different phases and theaters of the air war.

### Technical Issues

The original Air Force Commander suffered from a notable speed issue where "the speed of the game could not be slowed down"[^ref-9]. This problem was significant enough that a patch was eventually distributed over electronic bulletin boards to address the issue[^ref-9]. It is likely that WW2 Air Force Commander may have inherited or addressed similar technical concerns.

Critics also noted that Impressions' early efforts, including the Air Force Commander series, were characterized by "weak AI and cumbersome user interface"[^ref-9], suggesting areas where the development team faced ongoing challenges.

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

While specific sales figures for WW2 Air Force Commander are not available in historical records, the game contributed to Impressions Games' portfolio during a formative period for the company. Impressions would go on to achieve greater commercial success with city-building games like Caesar and Pharaoh before their acquisition by Sierra On-Line in 1995[^ref-8].

The Air Force Commander series demonstrated Impressions' early ambitions in the strategy game market, though the company would ultimately find its greatest success in different sub-genres of strategy gaming.

### Collections

WW2 Air Force Commander has been preserved as part of the MS-DOS Classic Games collection[^ref-6], ensuring its availability for historical gaming enthusiasts and researchers. The game is playable through browser-based emulation on several abandonware and retro gaming sites[^ref-4][^ref-6].

### Fan Projects

As an older strategy title with a relatively niche audience, WW2 Air Force Commander has not spawned significant fan remake projects. However, the game remains available through abandonware preservation efforts, with multiple sites hosting playable versions[^ref-7][^ref-10][^ref-4].

### Related Publications

- **User Manual:** 34-page manual included with the game, providing historical context and gameplay instructions[^ref-5]
- **Original Air Force Commander Manual:** 43 pages of Middle East history included with the predecessor game[^ref-11]

### Critical Perspective

WW2 Air Force Commander occupies an interesting niche in early 1990s strategy gaming. Released during a period when flight simulators were achieving new levels of sophistication through companies like Dynamix (whose founder Damon Slye noted that "Now when someone hears 'Dynamix' they immediately think 'flight simulator'"[^ref-13]), Impressions took a different approach by focusing on turn-based strategic command rather than real-time flight action.

The game represents an earnest attempt to bring air warfare strategy to PC gamers, though it competed in a crowded market against more polished titles. While Impressions would eventually achieve their greatest acclaim with city-building games, the Air Force Commander series demonstrates the company's early willingness to experiment with different strategy sub-genres.

The game's historical significance lies primarily in documenting the evolution of Impressions Games as a studio and showcasing the diversity of strategy games available during the DOS era. For enthusiasts of military history and vintage gaming, WW2 Air Force Commander remains an accessible window into 1990s strategy game design philosophies.

## See Also

WW2 Air Force Commander connects to the previous entry in the series, Cohort II - Fighting for Rome, through its shared developer, Impressions Games, and the continued exploration of strategic warfare themes. While Cohort II focused on ancient Roman military campaigns, WW2 Air Force Commander shifts the focus to aerial combat during World War II, introducing new gameplay mechanics such as air force management and tactical air operations. This evolution in gameplay reflects the studio's growing expertise in crafting immersive and historically grounded strategy experiences.

The narrative of WW2 Air Force Commander is self-contained, with players taking on the role of an air force commander during key moments of World War II. However, the game's themes of strategic leadership and resource management are consistent with the broader Impressions series, including the earlier Cohort II. The next entry in the series, Detroit, would likely continue this trend of exploring different historical or fictional settings while refining the core strategy gameplay that defines the Impressions brand.

In terms of mechanical evolution, WW2 Air Force Commander builds upon the turn-based strategy framework established by its predecessors, incorporating new features such as scenario selection and force management. These advancements lay the groundwork for future titles like Detroit, which may incorporate additional innovations in gameplay and storytelling while maintaining the series' commitment to strategic depth and historical authenticity. By examining the connections between WW2 Air Force Commander and its counterparts in the Impressions series, players can appreciate the studio's dedication to crafting engaging and challenging strategy games that cater to a wide range of historical and fictional interests.
