# Discovery: In the Steps of Columbus

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 27, 2026</small>

## Overview

Discovery: In the Steps of Columbus is a real-time strategy game of conquest and exploration released in 1992, timed to coincide with the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's voyage to the Americas[^ref-4]. Developed by Golden Sector and published by Impressions, the game places players in the role of a conquistador tasked with sending fleets of settlers to discover and colonize new worlds while competing against five other European nations[^ref-2]. The game features a comprehensive mouse-driven interface and allows players to choose their starting fatherland before embarking on their colonial endeavors[^ref-2].

The gameplay draws comparisons to Sid Meier's Civilization, requiring players to purchase ships, explore unknown territories shrouded in fog, and develop settlements through the construction of farms, warehouses, and defensive forts[^ref-3]. Players must balance exploration, economic development, and military defense against both competing colonial powers and native populations[^ref-2]. The game received mixed reviews upon release, with critics praising its realistic simulation of colonial-era challenges while criticizing its slow pace and user-unfriendly interface[^ref-4].

## Story Summary

The game's premise draws directly from the Age of Discovery, challenging players to venture "from beyond the horizon" and cross the Atlantic Ocean into the unknown[^ref-8]. Players must navigate treacherous waters where pirates threaten to sink ships in a cannon's flash, while rival European powers race to claim the Americas for themselves[^ref-8]. The narrative context places players as representatives of their chosen fatherland, tasked with establishing a colonial empire through exploration, settlement, and trade.

The goal is economic colonization—players must harvest the land through their settlers, producing goods to trade between their fatherland and their growing new world empire[^ref-8]. The game presents a stark win-or-lose scenario: if the player goes bankrupt, it's game over[^ref-4]. This economic pressure drives all strategic decisions as players balance the costs of exploration against the potential rewards of discovering and exploiting new territories.

To maintain an element of mystery and discovery, the developers created five imaginary worlds in addition to the historical Americas, ensuring that players cannot simply rely on historical knowledge to navigate their expeditions[^ref-9]. This design choice preserves the sense of venturing into the unknown that characterized the original Age of Exploration.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Discovery features a comprehensive mouse-driven interface that allows players to manage all aspects of their colonial enterprise[^ref-2]. The game runs on both OCS and ECS Amiga systems and is controlled entirely via mouse input[^ref-10]. Despite the intended ease of use, contemporary reviewers found the controls fiddly and buggy, with the cursor moving around jerkily and the menu system feeling disjointed and cumbersome[^ref-10]. One reviewer noted that the manual was "flash but useless for learning how to play the game," suggesting players "try playing it before reading the manual" as it "seems to make considerably more sense that way"[^ref-10].

### Structure and Progression

The game unfolds as players work to discover and colonize territories across six available new worlds[^ref-2]. The map begins as a wall of fog that is gradually revealed through exploration[^ref-11]. Gameplay follows a logical progression:

- **Acquisition:** Players first purchase ships from the bank to begin exploration[^ref-3]
- **Discovery:** Ships are sent into the unknown to encounter and map new land areas[^ref-4]
- **Settlement:** Once land is discovered, players establish colonies by building farms, warehouses, and forts[^ref-3]
- **Defense:** Forts are necessary to protect settlements from both natives and rival colonial powers[^ref-3]
- **Trade:** Developed settlements produce goods for trade between the new world and the fatherland[^ref-8]
- **Expansion:** Success allows for further exploration and settlement of additional territories

Five extra scenarios are available beyond the main campaign, offering variety in starting conditions and challenges[^ref-11].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The game operates as an economic and military simulation rather than a puzzle-focused title. Competition with five other AI-controlled nations drives much of the strategic challenge, requiring the game to feature a combat module for resolving conflicts[^ref-2]. Players must manage resources carefully, as bankruptcy results in immediate game over[^ref-4]. The trading system requires establishing profitable routes between colonies and the European homeland, while military units must be positioned to defend against hostile natives and rival colonial forces.

Right-clicking allows players to scroll around the discovered portions of the map, providing strategic oversight of their growing empire[^ref-3]. The aim is to settle all available areas while successfully fighting against enemy factions competing for the same territories[^ref-3].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Discovery: In the Steps of Columbus received mixed to poor reviews from contemporary gaming publications. Computer Gaming World's M. Evan Brooks gave the game just 2 out of 5 stars, calling it "slow, dull, user-unfriendly" and connecting its commercial failure to the broader cultural backlash against Columbus anniversary commemorations[^ref-4]. He noted that "the 500th Anniversary of Columbus was PIC (politically incorrect)" and that "the movies, television, books quickly became major 'busts'" with the game being "no different"[^ref-6].

Dragon magazine's Patricia and Kirk Lesser were more generous, awarding 3 out of 5 stars in their March 1993 issue (#191)[^ref-7]. French publication Tilt gave the game 6.5 out of 10, with reviewer Laurent Defrance describing it as "a good strategy game that offers a realistic simulation of the problems that may have occurred during the great colonization campaigns of the New World"[^ref-9].

Amiga magazine coverage was more extensive. Datormagazin gave the highest score at 82%[^ref-12], while ACAR and Amiga Mania both awarded 80%[^ref-12]. Amiga Power gave 75%[^ref-12], Amiga Format 72%[^ref-12], CU Amiga 71%[^ref-12], Amiga Joker 66%[^ref-13], and Amiga Action the lowest at 65%[^ref-14]. German publication Power Play was harshly critical, scoring the game just 23% with graphics at 30% and sound at 19%[^ref-13].

Multiple reviewers unfavorably compared the game to Sid Meier's Pirates!, with one stating it was "not a patch on Pirates for playability"[^ref-10]. Later retrospective commentary recommended players "go play Sid Meier's Colonization for Windows instead if you're a fan of the period"[^ref-6].

### Modern Assessment

Modern assessment of Discovery remains relatively sparse, reflecting its status as a largely forgotten title. The game holds a critics' average of 51% based on 5 ratings on MobyGames[^ref-2]. User ratings on preservation sites are somewhat more favorable—MyAbandonware shows a 4.33 out of 5 rating from 9 votes[^ref-6], while Emuparadise users gave it 4.4 out of 5 from 5 votes[^ref-15].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** 51% critics average (5 ratings)[^ref-2]
- **Moby Score:** 5.9[^ref-2]
- **MyAbandonware:** 4.33/5 (9 votes)[^ref-6]
- **Emuparadise:** 4.4/5 (5 votes)[^ref-15]

## Development

### Origins

Discovery: In the Steps of Columbus was developed by Golden Sector and published by Impressions (also known as Impressions Software or Impressions Games)[^ref-2]. The game was conceived as a tie-in to the 500th anniversary of Columbus's arrival in the Americas in 1492, joining numerous other media products attempting to capitalize on the quincentennial[^ref-4]. The original concept came from [[David Lester]], who also served as co-designer alongside [[Simon Bradbury]].

### Production

The development team at Golden Sector built upon their previous work, with the game engine being described as only "marginally improved" from their earlier title Merchant Colony[^ref-6]. This reuse of existing technology may explain some of the technical criticisms the game received regarding its sluggish performance and dated feel.

### Technical Issues

Contemporary reviewers documented numerous technical problems with the game. The controls were described as "fiddly and buggy" with a cursor that "moves around jerkily"[^ref-10]. The menu system felt "disjointed and cumbersome"[^ref-10], and the German version suffered from poor translation of screen texts[^ref-10].

Users on preservation sites have reported additional bugs including trader ships that "load forever but never actually load up and leave port to trade"[^ref-6]. The AI opponents were also criticized for failing too quickly, "making it a very short game and easy to win, even on harder levels"[^ref-6]. Some players noted that downloaded versions appear "more glitchy than the original"[^ref-6].

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- The game was released during a period when Columbus commemorations were becoming politically controversial, which reviewers suggested contributed to its commercial failure[^ref-4]
- The game includes a physical map/chart in the box packaging[^ref-10]
- Despite the Columbus theme, the game includes five fictional worlds in addition to the Americas to preserve the sense of exploration and prevent players from using historical knowledge[^ref-9]
- One user comment on a German retro gaming site recalled their brother-in-law calling it the "größte Fehlkauf seines Lebens" (biggest mis-purchase of his life)[^ref-13]

## Voice Cast

This game does not feature voice acting.

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Discovery: In the Steps of Columbus appears to have been a commercial disappointment, though specific sales figures are not available. The game's release coincided with a cultural backlash against Columbus anniversary commemorations, which M. Evan Brooks suggested negatively impacted its reception[^ref-4]. The game's ranking of #24,320 out of 27,500 games on MobyGames and collection by only 8 players indicates its minimal lasting impact[^ref-2].

### Collections

No compilations or collections including this title have been documented.

### Fan Projects

A WHDLoad installation package was created by Psygore in 2009 to allow the Amiga version to run on modern Amiga hardware and emulators[^ref-16]. This requires WHDLoad version 14 or higher, 512 KB of chip memory, and RawDIC for disk conversion[^ref-16]. An optional 1.0 MB of additional memory enables the preload feature for improved performance[^ref-16].

### Related Publications

- **Game Manual:** Included comprehensive gameplay instructions, described by reviewers as "flash but useless for learning how to play the game"[^ref-10]
- **Physical Map/Chart:** Included in box packaging[^ref-10]

### Critical Perspective

Discovery: In the Steps of Columbus represents a fascinating footnote in gaming history—a title that attempted to capitalize on a major historical anniversary only to be undermined by both its own technical shortcomings and a shifting cultural attitude toward its subject matter. The game arrived at a moment when the Columbus quincentennial had become politically fraught, with increasing attention paid to the devastating consequences of European colonization for indigenous peoples[^ref-4].

From a design perspective, the game occupied an awkward middle ground between the accessible action of Sid Meier's Pirates! and the deeper strategic complexity that Meier would later achieve with Colonization (1994). Laurent Defrance's assessment that it was "a good strategy game" hampered by controls that were "too heavy to manage" captures the consensus view[^ref-9]. The game's reuse of the Merchant Colony engine with only marginal improvements suggests a rushed development cycle attempting to meet the anniversary window[^ref-6].

The game has been largely forgotten in discussions of colonial-era strategy games, overshadowed entirely by Colonization, which addressed similar themes with far greater polish and depth. Its primary historical significance lies in demonstrating the risks of tying game development to external cultural events and the importance of robust playtesting and interface design.

## See Also

Discovery: In the Steps of Columbus builds upon the foundations established in Conquest of Japan, refining the Impressions game engine to deliver a more immersive real-time strategy experience. The shift from feudal Japan to the Age of Discovery introduces new gameplay mechanics, such as exploration and colonization, which add depth to the series. By allowing players to choose their starting nation and compete against other European powers, the game expands on the competitive elements seen in Conquest of Japan.

The narrative context of Discovery: In the Steps of Columbus sets the stage for the next entry in the series, Cohort II - Fighting for Rome, by introducing players to the concept of empire-building and resource management. Although the historical setting differs, the core gameplay principles of exploration, economic development, and military defense are refined in Discovery, laying the groundwork for the more focused, tactical experience offered in Cohort II. The evolution of the Impressions engine also enables more complex scenarios and challenging AI opponents, features that would become hallmark characteristics of the series.

As the series progresses from Conquest of Japan to Discovery: In the Steps of Columbus and eventually to Cohort II - Fighting for Rome, there is a noticeable shift towards more nuanced gameplay mechanics and richer historical contexts. The introduction of new worlds and the challenges of colonization in Discovery serve as a midpoint between the feudal warfare of Conquest of Japan and the ancient Roman setting of Cohort II, demonstrating the series' ability to adapt and evolve while maintaining its strategic core. This continuity ensures that players can appreciate the growth and refinement of the Impressions series across its various titles.
