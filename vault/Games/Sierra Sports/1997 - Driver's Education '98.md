## Overview

Driver's Education '98 is an educational driving simulator developed by [[Dynamix]] and published by [[Sierra On-Line]], with development beginning in 1997 and retail release in early 1998[^ref-1][^ref-4][^ref-22]. The software was designed to help prepare aspiring drivers for both the written examination and practical driving test, combining interactive test preparation with a fully realized 3D virtual city featuring real-world physics.[^ref-3] It was marketed as a "two-products-in-one" package, offering both a Driving Academy for test preparation and a 3D Virtual City for hands-on driving practice.[^ref-3]

The game represented one of the last titles published under Sierra's "Discovery Series" educational brand, which had previously produced various learning software throughout the 1990s.[^ref-4] Players could drive around in a virtual world accompanied by a virtual driving instructor named "Ed," who would guide them through lessons and provide feedback on their driving performance.[^ref-5] The program was notable for taking into account the specific driving laws of different U.S. states, allowing users to customize their learning experience based on their location.[^ref-4]

So confident were the developers in the effectiveness of Driver's Education that it was sold with an unprecedented money-back guarantee: if users didn't pass their driving test after completing the program, they could receive a full refund.[^ref-7] This bold marketing approach underscored the educational ambitions of the software, positioning it as a serious learning tool rather than mere entertainment. Contemporary assessments praised it as "an outstanding educational program that does exactly what it sets out to do: teaches driving in a safe environment without any risk of an accident."[^ref-7]

## Program Summary

Driver's Education '98 was structured as a comprehensive driving preparation tool rather than a traditional narrative-driven game. The software included access to driving manuals for all 50 United States, allowing users to study the specific rules and regulations applicable to their state.[^ref-8] This customization extended to the testing portions of the program, which could generate practice examinations based on state-specific requirements.[^ref-9]

The virtual driving environment was presented as a realistic city setting where users could practice various driving scenarios under the supervision of their virtual instructor, Ed.[^ref-5] Ed would provide guidance and commentary throughout the driving lessons, similar to how a real driving instructor would operate during behind-the-wheel training. The 3D Virtual City included various road types, traffic scenarios, and environmental conditions to prepare users for real-world driving challenges.[^ref-8]

The program featured more than 30 lessons covering different aspects of driving, from basic vehicle operation to more complex maneuvers like highway merging and parallel parking.[^ref-8] Users could progress through structured lessons or explore the virtual city freely, practicing skills at their own pace. The software tracked student behavior and provided feedback designed to reinforce safe driving techniques.[^ref-9]

Beyond the practical driving simulation, the Driving Academy component offered theoretical instruction including street symbol recognition, precautionary measures training, and comprehensive coverage of traffic laws.[^ref-10] Flash animations demonstrated proper techniques for various driving maneuvers, while diagrams illustrated concepts like lane changing and right-of-way rules.[^ref-8]

## Gameplay
