<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 30, 2026</small>

## Overview

Take a Break! Crosswords is a puzzle video game developed by [[Dynamix]] and N8 Productions, published by [[Sierra On-Line]] in 1992 for Windows 3.x[^ref-1][^ref-2]. The game was part of Sierra's initiative to create casual entertainment software designed for office workers seeking brief diversions during their workday[^ref-7]. The Macintosh version was developed by Presage Software Development Company and released in 1993[^ref-4][^ref-5].

The game features a collection of 375 crossword puzzles licensed from Dell Magazine, offering players a comprehensive digital crossword experience with multiple difficulty settings and puzzle sizes[^ref-2]. Take a Break! Crosswords represented an early effort to bring traditional newspaper-style puzzles into the emerging multimedia PC market, complete with digitized speech, sound effects, and animated graphics[^ref-6]. The Oregonian newspaper noted that the Eugene-based Dynamix's creation "should be a popular gift option for the upcoming holiday season"[^ref-6].

As Compute! Magazine observed, "Although designed for breaks in the workday, Crosswords Deluxe is an ideal way to jump-start your brain on those particularly slow mornings. It's more natural than caffeine, but no less habit-forming"[^ref-6]. The game was the first entry in Sierra's Take a Break! series, which would later include Take a Break! Pinball in 1993[^ref-7].

## Story Summary

Take a Break! Crosswords does not feature a narrative storyline. As a puzzle game, it focuses entirely on providing crossword solving challenges. The game is hosted by an animated elf character named Wanda who provides commentary and tracks player progress[^ref-1][^ref-2].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Take a Break! Crosswords presents players with a traditional crossword puzzle interface adapted for the Windows environment[^ref-1]. Players can navigate the grid using either mouse or keyboard input, with the ability to switch between across and down clues seamlessly[^ref-2]. The game features an intuitive point-and-click interface that allows users to select cells, enter letters, and navigate through clues with ease[^ref-6].

### Structure and Progression

The game contains 750 total puzzles across various sizes and difficulty levels[^ref-6]. Puzzles range from compact 13x13 grids to expansive 19x19 layouts, accommodating different time constraints and skill levels[^ref-1][^ref-2]. Players can track their progress through individual puzzles and across the entire collection[^ref-2].

The game includes an autochecking feature that can verify answers in real-time, a hint system for stuck players, and a scoring mechanism that rewards speed and accuracy[^ref-2]. A 65-page built-in crossword dictionary provides assistance for challenging clues[^ref-6].

One of the game's distinctive features is Wanda, an animated elf character who provides commentary and tracks player progress throughout their puzzle-solving sessions[^ref-1][^ref-2]. Wanda's animations and remarks add personality to the otherwise utilitarian puzzle experience[^ref-1].

## Development

### Origins

Take a Break! Crosswords emerged from Dynamix's efforts to expand beyond their traditional action and adventure game portfolio into the casual gaming market[^ref-7]. The concept was designed to appeal to office workers using Windows 3.x, capitalizing on the growing prevalence of personal computers in workplace environments[^ref-6]. Sierra On-Line saw an opportunity to reach a demographic that might not be interested in traditional video games but would appreciate digital versions of familiar pastimes[^ref-7].

### Production

The game was developed at Dynamix's Eugene, Oregon facility, with the company licensing crossword content from Dell Magazine to ensure puzzle quality and variety[^ref-2][^ref-6]. This licensing arrangement provided 375 professionally crafted puzzles without requiring Dynamix to develop crossword creation expertise internally[^ref-2].

The Macintosh port was handled by Presage Software Development Company, demonstrating Sierra's strategy of farming out platform conversions to specialized developers[^ref-4][^ref-5]. Presage's involvement allowed the game to reach Apple's user base without diverting Dynamix's Windows development resources[^ref-4].

By March 1996, the Take a Break! series had sold approximately 250,000 copies combined[^ref-7]. The game demonstrated that traditional puzzle formats could successfully transition to digital platforms, a concept that would later explode with web-based and mobile casual gaming[^ref-7].

### Collections

### Critical Perspective

Take a Break! Crosswords represents an important milestone in the evolution of casual gaming software. While not technologically groundbreaking, the game demonstrated that established puzzle formats could find new audiences through digital distribution and multimedia enhancement[^ref-6]. The addition of features like autochecking, hint systems, and the animated Wanda character showed thoughtful consideration of how to improve upon the paper puzzle experience rather than simply replicating it[^ref-1][^ref-2].

The game's design philosophy—creating bite-sized entertainment experiences for Windows users—presaged the casual gaming revolution that would transform the industry decades later[^ref-7]. Dynamix and Sierra's willingness to pursue this market, despite their reputation for larger-scale adventure and action titles, showed prescient awareness of computing's expanding role in daily life beyond dedicated gaming sessions[^ref-7].
