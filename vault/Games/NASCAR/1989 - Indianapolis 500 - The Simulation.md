<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 27, 2026</small>

## Overview

Indianapolis 500: The Simulation is a landmark racing video game released in December 1989, developed by [[Papyrus Design Group]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]][^ref-7]. It was hailed as the first step of differentiating racing games from the arcade realm and into true racing simulation, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of the genre[^ref-2]. The game accurately simulated the famous Indianapolis 500 Mile race, held annually at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Memorial Day weekend, one of the most famous automobile racing events in North America[^ref-3].

The game was notable in multiple respects, featuring one of the first true 3D polygon graphics engines to appear on the PC platform[^ref-4]. It represented the debut release from Papyrus Design Group, a studio that would go on to become legendary in the racing simulation genre[^ref-5]. The game's commitment to realism extended beyond graphics to include detailed car setup options, realistic physics, and an accurate representation of the 1989 Indianapolis 500 starting grid[^ref-6]. Magazine reviewers at the time suggested that anyone who couldn't handle the simulation's demanding gameplay should "stick to Out Run" or other less realistic software[^ref-7].

Indianapolis 500: The Simulation established many conventions that would define sim racing for decades to come, including cockpit-only perspective, detailed car customization, and authentic race day procedures[^ref-8]. The game's development team, led by David Kaemmer, would eventually evolve through various iterations of NASCAR and IndyCar simulations before morphing into iRacing, demonstrating the lasting impact of this pioneering title on the entire racing simulation industry[^ref-9].

## Story Summary

Indianapolis 500: The Simulation places players in the role of a rookie driver competing in the prestigious 1989 Indianapolis 500[^ref-3]. Unlike narrative-driven games, the title focuses entirely on the authentic racing experience, casting players as the driver of car number 17, which replaces Rich Vogler's Car #29 from the actual 1989 race[^ref-2]. Vogler had qualified 33rd and last place in the real event, giving players the challenge of starting from the back of the grid[^ref-6].

The game recreates the complete 1989 Indianapolis 500 field, featuring all 33 cars that competed in the actual race[^ref-9]. Players must navigate not only the high-speed challenges of the 2.5-mile oval circuit but also the strategic elements of pit stops, tire management, and fuel consumption[^ref-8]. The authentic starting lineup means players race against the same competitors who took to the track on that Memorial Day weekend in 1989[^ref-6].

The simulation allows players to experience the full race day journey, from qualifying sessions using a four-lap average system to the main event itself[^ref-3]. Race lengths can be customized to 10, 30, 60, or the full 200 laps, allowing both casual players and dedicated simulation enthusiasts to experience the Indianapolis 500 at their preferred intensity level[^ref-10]. Higher difficulty modes introduce car damage and the full-course yellow caution system, creating authentic race conditions[^ref-3].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Indianapolis 500: The Simulation presents the action exclusively from a first-person cockpit perspective, a bold design choice that was among the first in racing game history[^ref-8]. The game supports multiple input methods depending on platform: the PC version relies primarily on keyboard controls, while the Amiga version offers joystick, keyboard, and mouse options[^ref-8]. The interface displays essential racing telemetry including speed, RPM, lap times, and position information[^ref-10].

The game features an innovative and easy-to-use replay feature which allows players to re-run races from a variety of angles, and also pause and rewind the action[^ref-11]. This was a groundbreaking feature for its era, allowing players to analyze their performance and enjoy memorable racing moments from multiple perspectives. Sound support includes PC speaker, Tandy/PCjr, Ad Lib, and Roland MT-32 options, with the Roland providing the highest quality audio experience[^ref-4].

### Structure and Progression

The game structure follows the authentic Indianapolis 500 race weekend format:

- **Qualifying:** Players must complete four timed laps, with their average speed determining their starting position among the 33-car field[^ref-3]
- **Race Setup:** Before each race, players can adjust car settings to optimize performance for track conditions[^ref-10]
- **Race Day:** The main event features options from 10 laps to the full 200-lap distance[^ref-3]
- **Pit Strategy:** Managing tire wear and fuel consumption becomes critical in longer races[^ref-8]

The game offers three difficulty modes that fundamentally change the racing experience[^ref-3]. Lower modes remove car damage and the full-course yellow system, which can lead to repeat carnage including traffic collisions and huge pile-ups when crashes occur[^ref-3]. Higher difficulty settings demand careful car management and strategic decision-making throughout the race[^ref-10].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

While not featuring traditional puzzles, Indianapolis 500: The Simulation presents players with complex mechanical challenges that require understanding of racing dynamics[^ref-12]. The car setup system allows adjustment of wing down-force, tire pressures, wheel stagger, and turbo output, each directly affecting handling characteristics[^ref-2]. This was the first racing game to really allow car setup tweaking that directly affected handling[^ref-2].

Each of the three selectable Indy car chassis and engine combinations performs differently, requiring players to learn the unique characteristics of their chosen machine[^ref-9]. The game demands mastery of the racing line, braking points, and throttle control around the Indianapolis oval's four corners[^ref-8]. Fuel strategy and pit stop timing add another layer of complexity, as players must balance speed against the need to conserve resources over the race distance[^ref-10].

## Development

### Origins

Indianapolis 500: The Simulation emerged from Papyrus Design Group, a studio founded by David Kaemmer and Omar Khudari with the specific goal of creating authentic racing simulations[^ref-17]. The development budget totaled approximately $70,000 over an 18-month development period[^ref-7]. This modest budget produced a title that would fundamentally reshape expectations for racing game realism.

The development team sought to create an experience that accurately represented what it felt like to compete in the Indianapolis 500, going beyond the superficial representation of racing found in arcade games of the era[^ref-8]. The choice to focus exclusively on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway allowed the team to concentrate their efforts on perfecting every aspect of that single iconic venue[^ref-4]. Race Sim Central notes that side-by-side comparisons of the Indianapolis track in the game alongside real-life footage reveal "incredible" accuracy for the time the software was released[^ref-8].

### Production

The production of Indianapolis 500: The Simulation required solving numerous technical challenges, particularly in creating a functioning 3D polygon graphics engine on the limited hardware of late 1980s personal computers[^ref-4]. The team developed custom rendering technology that could shift colored 3D polygons around the screen at remarkable speeds, creating what Top Gear described as graphics that "look more like the world's most painful magic eye puzzle" by modern standards[^ref-9].

Rob Hubbard, who was new to Electronic Arts as music director at the time, composed the game's audio[^ref-2]. His work on the title helped establish the atmospheric sound design that would become a hallmark of simulation racing games. The game used manual-based copy protection, a common method of the period requiring players to answer questions from the physical documentation[^ref-2].
