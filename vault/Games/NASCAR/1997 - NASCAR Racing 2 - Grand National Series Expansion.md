<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 31, 2026</small>

## Overview

NASCAR Racing 2 Grand National Series Expansion was an add-on pack for Sierra's NASCAR Racing 2, developed by Papyrus Design Group in 1997.[^ref-1] The expansion pack added the complete Busch Grand National Series (now known as the Xfinity Series) cars and drivers to the base NASCAR Racing 2 game, allowing players to experience stock car racing's premier development series.[^ref-2] This expansion required the base NASCAR Racing 2 game to play and represented Papyrus's continued commitment to expanding their realistic racing simulation beyond just the Winston Cup series.[^ref-1]

The expansion was part of NASCAR Racing 2's evolution, which used a new game engine that improved graphics, physics, sound, and multiplayer capabilities over its predecessor.[^ref-3] Racing advisor voices were provided by Elton Sawyer and Patty Moise, adding authentic NASCAR commentary to the experience.[^ref-1] The game maintained the series' reputation for uncompromising realism, with one reviewer noting that "NASCAR 2 is not a toy" but rather a comprehensive racing simulation designed for serious racing enthusiasts.[^ref-4]

The Busch Grand National Series represented NASCAR's second-tier racing series, where up-and-coming drivers honed their skills before advancing to the Winston Cup. By adding this series to NASCAR Racing 2, Papyrus gave players the opportunity to follow the career path of real NASCAR drivers—starting in the Grand National Series before competing at the highest level.

## Story Summary

As a racing simulation, NASCAR Racing 2 Grand National Series Expansion does not feature a traditional narrative. Instead, the game recreates the authentic experience of competing in the Busch Grand National Series during the mid-1990s. Players create their own driver personas and compete against the real drivers and teams from that era, writing their own racing stories through competition.

The Grand National Series featured a mix of dedicated development drivers and Winston Cup veterans who would compete in select races. This created a unique competitive environment that the expansion faithfully recreated.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The expansion maintained NASCAR Racing 2's realistic control scheme, supporting keyboard, mouse, and racing wheel input devices.[^ref-8] The game featured advanced joystick and wheel support, with Joystick 1 configured for steering and Joystick 2 for pedals, though calibration was required for optimal performance.[^ref-8] Sierra's InterAction magazine acknowledged that "the only satisfying way to play is with the $130 steering wheel module," highlighting the game's emphasis on authentic simulation.[^ref-9]

The cockpit view provided a realistic driver's perspective, complete with working gauges and mirrors. Players needed to monitor their car's condition throughout races, balancing speed against the risk of mechanical failure or tire wear.

### Car Setup and Tuning

The expansion retained NASCAR Racing 2's comprehensive car setup system, where "every track must be considered individually when tweaking the design of your car, where you need to know where and when to pit, all while staying aware of your competition's position on the road."[^ref-4] Players could adjust numerous parameters:

**Chassis Settings:**
- Suspension stiffness and damping
- Ride height and weight distribution
- Anti-roll bar settings
- Wheel camber and toe

**Aerodynamic Settings:**
- Front and rear spoiler angles
- Radiator duct tape (reducing drag but increasing engine temperature)
- Restrictor plate configuration (for superspeedway races)

**Drivetrain and Gear Settings:**
- Final drive ratios
- Individual gear ratios for each gear
- Differential settings

This depth of customization meant that players who invested time in learning car setup could gain significant competitive advantages, particularly in the challenging conditions of longer races.

### Structure and Progression

The expansion added the complete Busch Grand National Series roster to NASCAR Racing 2's existing structure.[^ref-2] Players could race in both single races and full championship seasons, with the game supporting 1-8 players offline and up to 8 players over IPX networks.[^ref-3] The multiplayer functionality was particularly praised, with one player noting "The best part was the multiplayability. Whenever my friends and I would get together to play multi-player games, this one always worked right the first time, everytime."[^ref-10]

The championship mode allowed players to compete across a full season, accumulating points based on race finishes. Season modes required strategic thinking beyond individual races—managing equipment damage and making smart decisions about when to take risks.

### Racing Features

The game featured realistic car damage, customizable car paintshop options, advanced car tuning capabilities, and spotter voice feedback.[^ref-3] The spotter system included authentic reactions like "What did you do that for! What a bonehead move!" voiced by Ronald Gaines.[^ref-11] This spotter functionality helped players maintain situational awareness during races, providing warnings about nearby competitors and track conditions.

**Key Racing Features:**
- Real-time damage modeling affecting car performance
- Variable weather and track conditions
- Realistic tire wear and pit strategy
- AI drivers with individual racing styles
- Authentic track recreations with accurate layouts

### Track Selection

The expansion included tracks from the Busch Grand National Series schedule, giving players access to venues that differed from the Winston Cup calendar. These shorter tracks and road courses provided different challenges from the superspeedways that dominated Cup racing, requiring different driving techniques and car setups.
