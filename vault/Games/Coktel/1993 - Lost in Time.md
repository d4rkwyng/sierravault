<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 10, 2026</small>

## Overview

Lost in Time is a 1993 first-person point-and-click adventure game developed by French studio Coktel Vision and published in North America by Sierra On-Line[^ref-1]. Marketed as "The first Interactive Adventure Film using Full Motion Video Technology," the game represents an ambitious attempt to blend traditional adventure gameplay with emerging multimedia capabilities[^ref-2]. The game follows Doralice Prunelier, a young woman who finds herself mysteriously transported through time while investigating a shipwreck, ultimately becoming embroiled in a complex plot involving the Space Time Patrol and a dangerous criminal named Jarlath Equs[^ref-3].

The game occupies a fascinating intersection between classic adventure structure and early multimedia experimentation[^ref-4]. Coktel Vision, known for their Gobliiins series, positioned Lost in Time at the forefront of the multimedia revolution, making extensive use of 3D computer rendering and digitized actors[^ref-5]. Contemporary reviewers noted that "game play is interesting and movement through the 3D world is fluid"[^ref-6], though the game's difficulty and unconventional puzzle design divided critics and players alike.

Lost in Time has been described as "sort of like a bizarro French version of Back to the Future" due to its time-travel narrative and the ways in which protagonist Doralice must navigate both past and present to resolve the central conflict[^ref-5]. Despite its dramatic science fiction premise, the game maintains a silly, often absurdist tone that became characteristic of Coktel Vision's adventure titles[^ref-5].

## Story Summary

In 1992, a young woman named Doralice Prunelier is investigating a shipwreck when suddenly the vessel begins to move[^ref-3]. Disoriented and unable to understand what is happening, Doralice explores the ship and eventually discovers that she has been chosen—unknowingly—by the Central Computer of the Space-Time Patrol (STP) in the year 2092 to assist in a critical mission[^ref-8]. Her task is to search for and eventually arrest a thief named Jarlath Equs, who has stolen a rare radioactive element called Americium 1492 and hidden it somewhere in the past[^ref-8].

Doralice is selected because of her unique "historical-temporal ties" to Equs—she is actually a descendant of his wife[^ref-8]. Transported back to the year 1840 when the ship was still intact, Doralice has no choice but to explore her surroundings and unravel the mystery[^ref-9]. Her investigation takes her through three major locations in the past: the ship itself, a mysterious manor, and a lighthouse, before eventually reaching an island where the final confrontation with Equs will take place[^ref-10].

The game's narrative involves Doralice uncovering revelations about her own past while pursuing the dangerous criminal across time[^ref-9]. Along the way, she encounters numerous characters including Melkior, Yoruba, Velvet, Philibert, Oswald, Makandal, Delia, Celeucie, Amilcar, and Serapion[^ref-11]. The plot weaves together elements of science fiction, historical adventure, and personal discovery, as Doralice must stop a man who "plotted your doom centuries before you were born"[^ref-1].

The narrative is advanced primarily through cutscenes, with minimal dialogue and no conversation trees[^ref-12]. This design choice places emphasis on puzzle-solving and environmental exploration rather than character interaction, giving the game a more solitary, investigative feel compared to other adventure titles of the era.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Lost in Time is a completely mouse-driven first-person adventure game[^ref-12]. The interface features six icons at the top of the screen: a control panel, hints, notebook, inventory, map, and options[^ref-12]. Players interact with the environment by clicking on objects and areas of interest, with Doralice's actions shown through small picture-in-picture videos that display the results of each interaction—a feature that was "mighty impressive for something back in 1992"[^ref-5].

The game uses a modified version of the Gobliiins engine, previously seen in Inca II[^ref-13]. This engine supports the game's unique visual style, which combines full motion video, hand-painted backgrounds, digitized backgrounds, and 3D decor[^ref-2]. The three major locations in the game are rendered in completely different art styles, giving each area a distinct visual identity[^ref-5].

### Structure and Progression

The game is divided into several distinct areas that players must navigate:

- **The Ship:** The opening location where Doralice awakens and begins her investigation
- **The Manor:** A large estate with numerous rooms and puzzles to solve
- **The Lighthouse:** A key location involving navigation and environmental puzzles
- **The Island:** The final area where Doralice confronts Jarlath Equs[^ref-10]

Players must thoroughly explore each location, collecting items and solving puzzles to progress. The game features two timed puzzles toward the end, adding urgency to the final confrontation[^ref-12]. In Europe, the floppy disk version was divided into two parts called "Lost in Time: Parts 1 & 2," while the CD-ROM version contained both parts on a single disc with enhanced video sequences[^ref-6].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Lost in Time is notorious for its inventory-intensive puzzle design[^ref-14]. Players will face "literally hundreds of puzzles that require MacGuyver-like logic of combining household items into useful tools"[^ref-14]. The protagonist has been described as "the original MacGyver" due to the ingenious and logical nature of the puzzles[^ref-12]—reviewers noted that "the developers at Coktel must have watched too many episodes of 'MacGyver'"[^ref-13].

Typical puzzle solutions involve creative item combinations, such as using battery acid to rust locks, or combining seemingly unrelated objects to create functional tools[^ref-13]. The game character "touches everything, but does not take the time to examine things more closely," according to the manual[^ref-15], suggesting that players must be proactive in experimenting with inventory items.

The game includes a hint system called "Jokers" that is limited to only three uses throughout the entire playthrough[^ref-7]. Once used, these hints cannot be restored, making them a precious resource that players must use sparingly. This design choice contributes significantly to the game's reputation as "one of the most fiendishly difficult and intricate puzzle games you'll ever come across"[^ref-14].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Lost in Time received mixed to positive reviews upon release. Electronic Entertainment gave the game a score of 8/10 in their March 1994 issue[^ref-6]. PC Zone was more reserved in their assessment, awarding the game 69% in their November 1993 review[^ref-6]. Computer Gaming World noted that "game play is interesting and movement through the 3D world is fluid," though the review also highlighted some concerns about the game's difficulty[^ref-6].

Critics were divided on the game's voice acting, with some reviewers finding it problematic. Alex Bevilacqua stated bluntly that "The voice acting in this game is atrocious" and concluded that "Lost in Time is not fun"[^ref-7]. However, other reviewers found the storyline compelling enough to overlook technical shortcomings, with one fan noting that "even those that don't like the game love the storyline"[^ref-16].

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospectives have been more favorable toward Lost in Time. Home of the Underdogs described it as "arguably Coktel Vision's best game"[^ref-14]. MobyGames user MAT wrote that it is "probably the earliest 1st-person adventure game that I can think of as calling it a good one"[^ref-17], giving the game a positive assessment while admitting it's "Great, but I can't quite figure out why"[^ref-17].

The game has developed a cult following among adventure game enthusiasts. One player on GOG's wishlist noted: "This is the first game I played on the PC many years ago. Very underrated. Or possibly just my nostalgia talking"[^ref-18]. Another fan wrote: "Honestly, Lost In Time is one of my favorite games... the storyline is gripping and the puzzles are tastefully challenging"[^ref-16].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** 74% (22 critic ratings), 7.0/10 user rating[^ref-1]
- **Abandonware DOS:** 3.92/5.00[^ref-19]
- **MyAbandonware:** 4.4/5[^ref-14]
- **Amazon:** 3.2/5 stars[^ref-20]

## Development

### Origins

Lost in Time was developed by Coktel Vision, a French game company that had made its name with the Gobliiins series of adventure games[^ref-13]. The game represents Coktel Vision's venture into interactive movies following the success of their earlier titles[^ref-13]. Designer [[Muriel Tramis]], who had previously worked on the adult-oriented adventure game Fascination, created the character of Doralice Prunelier for that earlier title—making Lost in Time effectively a sequel featuring the same protagonist[^ref-18].

The game was developed during a period of significant change for Coktel Vision, as Sierra On-Line acquired the company in 1993[^ref-15]. Lost in Time was released shortly after this acquisition, with Coktel Vision handling European distribution while Sierra On-Line managed North American publishing[^ref-6].

### Production

Coktel Vision positioned themselves at the forefront of the multimedia revolution with Lost in Time, making extensive use of emerging technologies including 3D computer rendering and digitized actors[^ref-5]. The game was marketed as "The first Interactive Adventure Film using Full Motion Video Technology"[^ref-2], though this claim was somewhat hyperbolic given other FMV titles of the era.

The development team created three distinct visual styles for the game's major locations, each rendered using different techniques[^ref-5]. This approach gave Lost in Time a unique aesthetic that set it apart from other adventure games of the period. The game was released the same year as The 7th Guest and Myst[^ref-7], placing it in direct competition with other titles pushing the boundaries of multimedia gaming.

**Development Credits:**[^ref-1]
- **Designer:** Muriel Tramis
- **Composer:** Charles Callet

### Technical Achievements

Lost in Time featured four distinct graphical elements: full motion video, hand-painted backgrounds, digitized backgrounds, and 3D decor[^ref-2]. "Every time you take an action, there's a small picture-in-picture video showing the result"[^ref-5], a technique that was innovative for 1992-1993 and added immersion to the gameplay experience.

The game used the Gob engine, a modified version of the interpreter previously seen in the Gobliiins series and Inca II[^ref-7]. This engine supported the game's hybrid visual approach and handled the integration of live-action video clips with the point-and-click adventure gameplay.

### Cut Content

Audio analysis of the game files has revealed three unused audio tracks: dora1.adl, dora3.adl, and dora4.adl[^ref-22]. The purpose of these tracks and why they were cut from the final release remains unknown.

### Version History

| Version | Date | Platform | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| Floppy (Parts 1 & 2) | 1993 | DOS | European release, divided into two parts[^ref-6] |
| CD-ROM | 1993 | DOS | Single disc with both parts, enhanced video[^ref-6] |
| US Floppy | 1993 | DOS | Single combined release[^ref-15] |
| CD-ROM (NA) | 1994 | DOS | North American CD release via Sierra[^ref-6] |

**Gob Engine Information:**[^ref-7]

The game uses the Gob engine, which was Coktel Vision's proprietary adventure game interpreter. ScummVM has supported Lost in Time since version 0.12.0[^ref-9].

### Technical Issues

Lost in Time has known compatibility issues with later Windows versions. "XP's emulation of the old DOS driver (MSCDEX) is imperfect, so the game may lock up"[^ref-21]. The game is part of a group of Coktel Vision CD games that have compatibility issues with Windows NT environments[^ref-21].

When running in DOSBox, users reported various problems: "None of the Coktel Vision games seem to work quite right in it"[^ref-24]. Cutscenes in the game are timed based on the audio track, which can cause synchronization issues in emulation[^ref-24]. Some users also reported graphical errors: "I still have the disc but even with ScummVM running the game there is little graphical errors like the colors mess up in places"[^ref-18]. DOSBox compatibility issues were reportedly fixed in the CVS version as of August 2005[^ref-24].

The CD-ROM version has been noted to have "poor lip-synching" in cinematics, where "during close-ups, only actor's lips move but not the head"[^ref-13].

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- The protagonist Doralice Prunelier previously appeared in Coktel Vision's adult-oriented adventure game Fascination, where she appeared nude[^ref-13]
- The game's box and documentation did not indicate that Lost in Time was a sequel to Fascination[^ref-18]
- Lost in Time has been compared to Back to the Future due to its time-travel narrative structure[^ref-5]
- The game features 3D prerendered rooms, which was cutting-edge technology for 1993[^ref-22]
- One fan called it "one of the hardest games I've ever played"[^ref-25]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Lost in Time was part of Coktel Vision's portfolio when Sierra On-Line acquired the French developer in 1993[^ref-15]. The game was distributed through Sierra's North American channels, giving it broader international exposure than many European-developed adventure games of the era[^ref-6].

### Collections

The game has appeared in various compilations and has been made available through abandonware channels following the end of its commercial availability[^ref-3]. Archive.org hosts multiple versions of the game for preservation purposes, including installation packages compatible with modern systems through DOSBox[^ref-3].

### Fan Projects

Lost in Time is supported by ScummVM since version 0.12.0, allowing the game to run on modern operating systems without DOSBox[^ref-9]. The game has been requested on GOG.com's community wishlist, with fans expressing continued interest in an official digital re-release[^ref-18].

### Related Publications

- **Game Manual:** Included with original release, contains character background and gameplay instructions[^ref-15]
- **Walkthrough Guides:** Multiple fan-created walkthroughs exist, including comprehensive guides on GameFAQs, GameBoomers, and The Spoiler[^ref-16][^ref-12][^ref-25]

### Critical Perspective

Lost in Time represents an important transitional moment in adventure game history, arriving at the intersection of traditional point-and-click design and the emerging multimedia revolution of the early 1990s. While the game was overshadowed by higher-profile releases like The 7th Guest and Myst in the same year[^ref-7], it demonstrated Coktel Vision's willingness to experiment with new technologies and narrative approaches.

The game's MacGyver-like puzzle design, while frustrating to some players, established a distinct identity that set it apart from the more straightforward inventory puzzles of Sierra and LucasArts titles. Modern retrospectives have generally been kinder to Lost in Time than contemporary reviews, recognizing it as an ambitious and unique entry in the adventure game canon. Its first-person perspective and emphasis on environmental puzzle-solving anticipated design trends that would become more prominent in later years.

The game also holds historical significance as one of the earlier adventure games to feature a female protagonist in a non-comedic role[^ref-13], though this distinction is complicated by the character's origins in the adult-oriented Fascination. Muriel Tramis's design work on Lost in Time contributed to her legacy as one of the few prominent female game designers of the era.

## See Also

Lost in Time is technically a standalone title, though its protagonist Doralice Prunelier previously appeared in Coktel Vision's adult-oriented adventure game Fascination[^ref-18]. The connection between the two games was not indicated in Lost in Time's packaging or documentation, leaving many players unaware of the shared continuity[^ref-18]. The games share the same protagonist but feature very different tones and subject matter.

- **Previous:** Fascination (1991) – Same protagonist, adult-oriented adventure
- **Next:** None – Lost in Time was Doralice's final appearance
