## Overview

*Fascination* is an erotic thriller graphic adventure game developed by Tomahawk and published by Coktel Vision in 1991 for the Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS platforms.[^ref-1] The game places players in the role of Doralice May, described as "the sexiest captain on the Paris-Miami flight," who becomes entangled in a dangerous conspiracy involving a revolutionary chemical substance after a dying passenger entrusts her with a mysterious vial.[^ref-2] As a first-person point-and-click adventure, *Fascination* represented the third and final entry in Coktel Vision's short-lived line of mature-themed adventure games that began with *Emmanuelle* (1989) and continued with *Geisha* (1990).[^ref-3]

The game was designed by [[Muriel Tramis]], one of the pioneering female game designers in the French video game industry, whose work frequently featured female protagonists and mildly erotic scenes.[^ref-4] Despite its adult themes, *Fascination* was noted for having "sensible problems with sensible solutions, not based on minigames or external sources of information, but on logical use of items you'll find."[^ref-5] The protagonist Doralice would later return in Coktel Vision's *Lost in Time* (1993), establishing a loose continuity between the games.[^ref-6]

Contemporary reception was mixed, with French publications rating the PC version highly (90-91%) while Amiga reviews ranged more widely from 47% to 80%.[^ref-7] The game has been described as "a less grotesque version of Leisure Suit Larry but with a more pronounced sensuality," offering what one reviewer called a "clever mix between eroticism and thriller."[^ref-8]

## Story Summary

The narrative opens with Jeffrey Miller, CEO of Quantum Unlimited Laboratory (Q.U.L.), who has discovered a revolutionary cerebro-chemical substance capable of neutralizing behavioral inhibitors—essentially a drug that dramatically increases sex drive.[^ref-11] Miller's right-hand man, Fayard Nichols, is transporting a prototype vial of this substance when he suffers a fatal heart attack aboard a Paris-to-Miami flight.[^ref-12] In his dying moments, Nichols places the vial into the hands of Captain Doralice May, the flight's commanding officer, imploring her to deliver it into safe hands.[^ref-2]

Upon landing in Miami, Doralice finds herself thrust into a dangerous conspiracy. The chemical's potential has attracted numerous interested parties, and Miller himself has been assassinated.[^ref-13] Doralice must navigate Miami's various locales—including a lingerie shop in Coconut Grove, a jazz club in Little Havana, and the historic Villa Vizcaya—to uncover the truth and deliver the vial to its rightful recipient, Miller's son Kenneth.[^ref-6] Throughout her investigation, she must "often lie, use her charms and especially use her wits to conduct her little investigation and solve the mystery."[^ref-6]

The player receives instructions from a recorded message left by Miller himself, directing Doralice to recover a stolen vial and deliver both samples to Kenneth.[^ref-14] The investigation involves interacting with various colorful characters, including Inspector Pedro di Helgos, while avoiding being framed for the murders that follow Doralice wherever she goes.[^ref-15] The game's ending has been noted for its surprising twist, with one critic observing that "*Fascination*'s ending predicted the finale of David Fincher's film *The Game* (1997)"[^ref-1]—though another reviewer called it "perhaps the stupidest ending of any game in history."[^ref-1]

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

*Fascination* employs a first-person perspective with a point-and-click interface, typical of adventure games from this era.[^ref-1] Players interact with the environment using a mouse-driven interface, clicking on objects and characters to examine or manipulate them.[^ref-16] Items discovered during exploration can be placed in an inventory for later use, and the plot advances through dialogue with characters and puzzle-solving.[^ref-17] The game can be saved at any time using the F1 key.[^ref-3]

### Structure and Progression

The game follows a linear progression through various Miami locations as Doralice investigates the conspiracy. The structure requires players to gather information, collect items, and solve puzzles to advance.[^ref-17] Notably, the game does not allow backtracking—if players miss an important item in one location, they cannot return for it and must restore a previous save.[^ref-18]

- **Airport/Airplane:** The opening sequence where Doralice receives the vial from the dying Nichols
- **Pelican Hotel:** Doralice's base of operations in Miami[^ref-14]
- **Coconut Grove:** Features a lingerie shop important to the investigation[^ref-6]
- **Little Havana:** Contains a jazz club with vital clues[^ref-6]
- **Quantum Unlimited Laboratory:** Miller's research facility[^ref-14]
- **Villa Mollière/Villa Vizcaya:** Climactic location for the game's finale[^ref-6]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The puzzles in *Fascination* were praised for their logical nature, relying on sensible application of inventory items rather than minigames or external knowledge requirements.[^ref-5] However, the game does feature several design challenges that frustrated players:

- **Pixel hunting:** Some items are difficult to locate on screen without careful searching[^ref-18]
- **Random elements:** Phone numbers and access codes change with each playthrough, requiring players to find them in-game rather than using guides directly[^ref-19]
- **Death traps:** Players can die unexpectedly through dialogue choices or timing mistakes, such as ringing a studio doorbell three times resulting in game over[^ref-20]
- **Newspaper collection:** Six newspapers are scattered throughout the game, and players must collect at least five to achieve victory[^ref-20]

One notable puzzle involves an aquarium containing piranhas—players who attempt to retrieve an item without following the correct procedure will be bitten.[^ref-20]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

French gaming publications gave *Fascination* high marks upon its initial release on PC. *Génération 4* (Issue 38) awarded the game 91%, with reviewer Christian Roux praising the title in November 1991.[^ref-7] Similarly, *Joystick* (Issue 21) gave the PC version 90%, reviewed by Moulinex in the same month.[^ref-7]

The Amiga version received more varied scores across European publications. *CU Amiga* gave the game 80%, with reviewer Tony Dillon noting its strengths in September 1992.[^ref-7] *Amiga Games* awarded 79% from Lutz Mahle in December 1992, while *Amiga Mania* gave 78% from Jeff Davy in November 1992.[^ref-7] Lower scores came from *Amiga Power* at 67% (Jonathan Davies, September 1992), *Amiga Format* at 65% (James Leach, October 1992), and *The One Amiga* at 62% (Khalid Howlader, September 1992).[^ref-7]

The most critical Amiga reviews came from *Amiga Action* (51%, Peter Lee), *Amiga Joker* (48%, Oskar Dzierzynski), and *Amiga Computing* (47%, Ben Styles).[^ref-7] One Amiga reviewer commented that "the French just aren't funny any more," finding the humor fell flat.[^ref-21]

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospectives have been mixed. *Hardcore Gaming 101* observed that "like most purportedly 'adult' games, *Fascination* is largely fixated on cheap thrills and ridiculously juvenile humor."[^ref-2] The *Adventurers' Guild* blog gave the game a score of 42, noting that while sexuality was "mostly just there to spice things up... it's all very much like a light version of Leisure Suit Larry."[^ref-5]

The *Atari Legend* retrospective was more nostalgic, with the reviewer stating "I seriously don't know what to do with this one. To me *Fascination* is a classic, mostly because of nostalgic reasons."[^ref-22] The site awarded scores of 9 for graphics, 8 for sound, 6 for gameplay, and 7 overall.[^ref-23]

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** 64%[^ref-24]
- **Abandonware DOS:** 3.91/5.00[^ref-25]
- **MyAbandonware:** 4.4/5 (86 votes)[^ref-18]
- **Lemon Amiga Average:** 64%[^ref-9]

## Development

### Origins

*Fascination* emerged from Coktel Vision's experimentation with mature-themed adventure games in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The company, known for both educational titles and adult content, had previously released *Emmanuelle* (1989) and *Geisha* (1990) before developing *Fascination* as the third and final entry in this unofficial trilogy.[^ref-18] The game was designed by Muriel Tramis, whose work consistently featured female protagonists and explored themes of sensuality within adventure game frameworks.[^ref-4]

### Production

Development was handled by Tomahawk, with Coktel Vision serving as publisher.[^ref-1] The game was built using the Gob engine, which would later power other Coktel Vision titles including the popular *Gobliiins* series.[^ref-10] The team included concept designer Muriel Tramis and manager Philippe Lamarque, with graphics created by Joseph Kluytmans, Rasheed, and Yannick Chosse.[^ref-9]

An interesting technical challenge arose during development: the programmers could not play .MOD music files on PC, so they sampled the Amiga music and converted it for DOS playback using Intersound MDO sound technology.[^ref-24]

**Development Credits:**[^ref-9][^ref-24]
- **Concept Designer:** Muriel Tramis
- **Manager:** Philippe Lamarque
- **Graphics:** Joseph Kluytmans, Rasheed, Yannick Chosse
- **Composer:** Frédéric Motte
- **Voice Actors (CD version):** Phil Mac Alpine, Marina Albert, Catherine Lypszyc

### Technical Achievements

The game's visual presentation was notable for its creative approach to imagery. According to the French Wikipedia article, "images use creative presentation—not always full screen, cut into silhouettes, women's faces, extended bodies, dripping daggers."[^ref-6] The Atari ST version utilized 16 colors effectively, earning praise for its graphics in reviews.[^ref-23]

The music was composed by Frédéric Motte (credited as "Moby" in some versions), who later recalled these compositions as his "first gigs in the video game industry."[^ref-27] The composer, who came from the Amiga demo scene, was not the famous musician Moby but shared the nickname.[^ref-23]

The game uses the Gob engine, which was later employed for the *Gobliiins* series and other Coktel Vision titles. The CD version stores STK files hidden on the disc, and the game is supported by ScummVM for modern playback.[^ref-10]

### Technical Issues

Several design decisions created frustration for players:

- **No backtracking:** Missing items in previous areas requires restoring saves[^ref-18]
- **Pixel hunting:** Small interactive objects can be easily missed[^ref-18]
- **Random codes:** Phone numbers and access codes change each playthrough, preventing direct walkthrough use[^ref-19]
- **Instant deaths:** Certain dialogue options or actions result in immediate game over[^ref-20]
- **Miller's phone number:** Must be dialed correctly to avoid softlocking the game[^ref-20]

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

The game contains several optional interactions and hidden content:[^ref-20]
- **Bathroom scene:** Players can enter the bathroom to see Doralice nude (optional interaction)
- **Parking lot jokes:** Clicking on cars in the parking lot triggers humorous animations
- **Lingerie shop mirror:** Clicking the mirror shows Doralice trying on different outfits
- **Poster interactions:** Clicking posters in the lingerie backroom produces entertaining responses
- **Microscope secret:** Using the signet ring on a microscope reveals a randomly generated birth date

Additional trivia:
- One reviewer compared the game's aesthetic to "a Bruckheimer movie from the 80's, complete with blond dudes with full tans, gigantic shades, gigantic hair, fast cars and fast women"[^ref-24]
- The *Atari Legend* reviewer noted "this game sounds like a porn movie!" upon first encountering it[^ref-22]
- Solution guides were published across three issues of *Amiga Power*[^ref-7]

| Character | Voice Actor |
|-----------|-------------|
| Various | Phil Mac Alpine |
| Various | Marina Albert |
| Various | Catherine Lypszyc |

Note: Doralice's voice actress in *Lost in Time* (1993) was Dominique Laurencine, though it's unclear if she voiced the character in *Fascination*'s CD version.[^ref-30]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

While specific sales figures are not available, *Fascination* represented the conclusion of Coktel Vision's mature-themed adventure game line.[^ref-18] The game was released across multiple European markets including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, with a United States release following in 1992.[^ref-18] Digital Integration served as publisher for some regional releases.[^ref-1]

### Collections

The protagonist Doralice May returned in *Lost in Time* (1993), creating an informal continuity between the games.[^ref-6] *Fascination* itself remained a standalone title and has not appeared in major compilation releases, though it has been preserved through abandonware archives and ScummVM support.[^ref-10]

### Fan Projects

The game is supported by ScummVM, the open-source adventure game engine, allowing it to be played on modern systems without requiring DOSBox.[^ref-10] Various abandonware sites have preserved both the floppy and CD-ROM versions for historical purposes.[^ref-18]

### Related Publications

- **Walkthrough Guides:** Multiple fan-created walkthroughs exist, including comprehensive guides on GameFAQs (Version 1.3, July 2022)[^ref-19] and StrategyWiki[^ref-14]
- **Magazine Solutions:** *Amiga Power* published a complete solution across three issues (Issues 18, 19, and 20)[^ref-7]

### Critical Perspective

*Fascination* occupies an unusual position in adventure game history as a mature-themed title designed by a woman during an era when such games were predominantly created by and for male audiences.[^ref-4] Muriel Tramis brought a distinctly different sensibility to the genre, using sexuality as atmosphere rather than the primary focus—"mostly just there to spice things up" rather than as explicit content.[^ref-5]

The game also represents an interesting moment in French game development, when Coktel Vision was establishing itself as a significant European studio before its eventual acquisition by Sierra Entertainment. While not a commercial breakthrough, *Fascination* demonstrated that adventure games could incorporate adult themes without becoming purely pornographic, paving the way for more nuanced treatments of sexuality in later games.

The observation that the game's ending anticipated David Fincher's *The Game* (1997) speaks to its ambition, even if execution sometimes fell short.[^ref-1] As one modern reviewer summarized: "*Fascination* stands in this last category, probably in the lowest tier of it but is not a horrible game"—a fair assessment of a title that attempted something different within the constraints of early 1990s adventure game design.[^ref-8]
