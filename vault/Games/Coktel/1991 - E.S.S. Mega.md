## Overview

E.S.S. Mega (European Space Simulator Mega) is a space shuttle simulation game developed by [[Coktel Vision]] and published by Tomahawk in 1991[^ref-1]. The game stands as one of the most unique space simulations of its era, focusing exclusively on the European Space Agency's vehicle concepts rather than the more commonly simulated NASA programs[^ref-2]. According to French magazine *Joystick*, E.S.S. Mega holds the distinction of being one of the first PC games released on CD-ROM, with both disc and floppy versions made available simultaneously[^ref-3].

The game utilizes 3D-modeled graphics to create a comprehensive space shuttle simulation experience that emphasizes micro-level decision-making over macro-level space program policies[^ref-5]. Players manage every aspect of space shuttle operations, from equipping vessels with cargo, crew, and fuel to piloting during launch, orbital operations, and landing procedures[^ref-5]. The simulated timeline spans from January 2010 to December 2013, presenting a near-future vision of European space exploration[^ref-2].

E.S.S. Mega represented an enhanced version of the original E.S.S. (European Space Simulator), which was released in 1989[^ref-6]. The "Mega" edition featured expanded content, and the CD-ROM version included over 200 MB of digitized photographs and video footage from actual space exploration archives, along with a 300 MB CD audio soundtrack[^ref-7]. The game has been described as "probably the most obscure game ever made by quirky French developer Coktel Vision" and "one of the rarest space simulations"[^ref-8].

## Story Summary

E.S.S. Mega places players in command of a European space program during the early 2010s, tasking them with managing all aspects of space shuttle operations and orbital infrastructure development[^ref-2]. The game recreates the European Space Agency's ambitious space vehicle concepts from the early 1990s, with particular emphasis on the Hermes Shuttle program that was then under development[^ref-9].

The campaign spans a four-year period from January 2010 to December 2013, during which players must successfully execute numerous space missions[^ref-2]. The narrative framework positions the player as a director responsible for building Europe's presence in space through careful management of resources, personnel, and mission objectives. Unlike more arcade-oriented space games, E.S.S. Mega presents a methodical simulation of real spacecraft operations.

The game's scenario reflects the optimistic projections of the late 1980s European space program, envisioning a future where ESA would operate its own reusable shuttle craft and maintain permanent orbital facilities[^ref-9]. Players work toward goals including satellite deployment, space station construction, and scientific experimentation in orbit. The setting provides both a strategic management challenge and an educational glimpse into the technical realities of spaceflight operations.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

E.S.S. Mega features a mouse-driven interface that provides access to various mission control screens and piloting views[^ref-1]. The game offers both first-person and third-person perspectives during flight sequences, allowing players to experience orbital operations from multiple viewpoints[^ref-1]. The interface was designed to be more accessible than competing titles; as one contemporary assessment noted, unlike the NASA-focused simulations Space Shuttle and MAX, "this game is much more friendly to the player (that does not negate its overall difficulty and complexity of interface)"[^ref-10].

### Structure and Progression

The game features one extended campaign that follows the development of a European space program over several years[^ref-5]. Progression emphasizes micro-level decisions over macro-level policy considerations, requiring players to carefully manage each mission's details[^ref-5].

- **Mission Preparation:** Players equip the space shuttle with appropriate cargo, select crew members, and determine fuel loads[^ref-5]
- **Launch Operations:** Execute launch procedures and guide the shuttle into orbit[^ref-5]
- **Orbital Activities:** Pilot the shuttle in full 3D, deploy and maintain satellites, conduct docking operations[^ref-6]
- **Space Station Management:** Build and manage orbital facilities to conduct experiments[^ref-5]
- **Return and Landing:** Navigate the shuttle back through the atmosphere and land on the Corporation's shuttle-carrier[^ref-7]

The strategic element of the game often prevails over pure simulation aspects, requiring players to balance budgetary concerns against mission objectives[^ref-10].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The game's challenges center on resource management and technical decision-making rather than traditional puzzle-solving[^ref-5]. Players must carefully calculate fuel requirements, cargo weights, and mission parameters to ensure successful operations[^ref-5]. The in-game space database provides extensive reference information to assist with these calculations[^ref-5].

Budget management represents a critical gameplay element, as players must fund all aspects of their space program while achieving mission objectives[^ref-6]. The simulation covers the complete operational cycle from launch preparations through orbital operations to safe return[^ref-6].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

E.S.S. Mega received generally positive reviews upon release, with particularly strong scores from French gaming publications. *Joystick* magazine awarded the PC floppy version 89% and the CD-ROM version an even higher 91%, reflecting the enhanced multimedia content of the disc release[^ref-2][^ref-3]. French magazine *Génération 4* gave both the PC and Atari ST versions 77%[^ref-2].

The CDTV version received more modest assessments. *Amiga Joker* reviewed the CDTV release in October 1992, with reviewer Joachim Nettelbeck awarding it 3 out of 5 stars[^ref-11][^ref-12]. The original E.S.S. on Amiga had received 76% from *Amiga Joker* (reviewer Michael Labiner, March 1990) and 68% from *CU Amiga* (reviewer Mark Patterson, February 1990), giving an average magazine rating of 72%[^ref-6].

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospectives have been somewhat mixed. The game is recognized for its historical significance and technical ambition, though its complexity and obscurity have limited its contemporary audience[^ref-8]. Home of the Underdogs assigned the game a rating of 8.69, placing it among the higher-rated titles in their database[^ref-13].

One modern assessment characterized the game as a "lackluster space shuttle simulation" that lacks the random elements that made competing titles like Buzz Aldrin's space programs challenging, suggesting it is "worth a look for space buffs, but only for historical interest"[^ref-8]. However, another review praised the game's graphics as "not just all bright and beautiful, but often there is a serious hint of three-dimensionality"[^ref-10].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **Home of the Underdogs:** 8.69[^ref-13]
- **MobyGames:** 83%[^ref-1]
- **Lemon Amiga (E.S.S. original):** 72% average[^ref-6]

## Development

### Origins

The development of E.S.S. Mega was directly influenced by the professional background of Coktel Vision founder Roland Oskian, who had previously worked at Matra Espace, a major French aerospace company[^ref-14]. This experience in the space industry made the subject matter "pretty obvious" for Coktel Vision to pursue[^ref-14]. The game represented the company's first step toward embracing new technology, particularly CD-ROM distribution[^ref-14].

E.S.S. Mega built upon the foundation established by the original E.S.S. (European Space Simulator), which was developed by Inférence and released in 1989 for the Amiga[^ref-6]. The original game had established the core simulation mechanics and earned respectable reviews, providing a solid base for the enhanced "Mega" edition.

### Production

Development was handled by Coktel Vision with technical consultation from space industry professionals[^ref-1]. The team received special acknowledgment from Matra and the European Space Agency (ESA) for their assistance in ensuring technical accuracy[^ref-12]. The CD-ROM version required extensive work to integrate authentic space exploration footage and photography, resulting in over 500 MB of multimedia content[^ref-7].

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Specific sales figures for E.S.S. Mega have not been documented, though the game's rarity in the collector market suggests limited distribution[^ref-3]. The CD-ROM version represented an important step for Coktel Vision in embracing emerging distribution technology, helping establish the company's technical capabilities ahead of their later multimedia adventure games[^ref-14].

### Critical Perspective

E.S.S. Mega occupies a unique position in simulation game history as one of the few titles to focus on European space programs rather than NASA operations[^ref-9]. This distinctive approach gave the game educational value beyond its entertainment merits, introducing players to ESA concepts like the Hermes Shuttle that were then under active development.

The game demonstrated Coktel Vision's willingness to pursue unusual subject matter—a trait that would characterize many of their later releases including the *Gobliiins* series and *Lost in Time*[^ref-8]. Home of the Underdogs aptly described Coktel Vision as "famous for quirky, wacky games that can only come from France"[^ref-13].

As a technical achievement, E.S.S. Mega's early adoption of CD-ROM distribution foreshadowed the multimedia revolution that would transform PC gaming throughout the 1990s[^ref-14]. While the game itself may not have achieved widespread recognition, its role in pioneering new distribution formats gives it historical significance beyond its gameplay merits.
