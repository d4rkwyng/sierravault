<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

3-D Ultra Radio Control Racers Deluxe: Traxxas Edition is an arcade-style racing game developed by [[Dynamix]] and published by [[Sierra On-Line]] in 2000.[^ref-1] The game recreates the nostalgic experience of playing with radio-controlled cars, offering players the thrill of RC racing without the disappointing hourly charge-ups of real-world models.[^ref-2] As an update to the hot-selling original 3-D Radio Control Racers, the Traxxas Edition featured eight new tracks and two new game modes, bringing the total to sixteen tracks of "insane jumps, twisting turns and off-the-wall pitfalls."[^ref-3]

The game promised "little cars, huge fun," inviting players to select from four car models, upgrade and customize them, then compete across fourteen hilarious tracks filled with unexpected obstacles and hazards.[^ref-4] True to the 3-D Ultra series' signature style, the game featured whimsical hazards including "mad chickens, sea monsters, anarchist lawn gnomes" that players had to navigate during fast and furious racing.[^ref-1] The Traxxas Edition partnership brought official RC car branding to the experience, lending authenticity to the virtual racing.[^ref-5]

Part of the 3-D Ultra series influx during the final year of the millennium, alongside titles like TrainTown and Cool Pool, this game represented Dynamix's continued commitment to accessible, family-friendly entertainment software.[^ref-6] The game was rated "E for Everyone" by the ESRB with no content descriptors, making it suitable for all ages.[^ref-7] Some fans have even credited the game with innovating car-soccer gameplay that would later be popularized by games like Rocket League.[^ref-8]

## Story Summary

Unlike traditional racing games with narrative frameworks, 3-D Ultra Radio Control Racers Deluxe: Traxxas Edition focuses purely on the racing experience without an overarching storyline.[^ref-2] The game's premise is simple: players take control of miniature radio-controlled cars and compete across a variety of imaginative tracks designed to evoke childhood memories of backyard RC racing.[^ref-2]

The game's environments tell their own stories through creative track design. Players race through diverse locations including a frog pond, construction site, backyard setting, pirate cove, and a miniature golf course complete with a rocket, windmill, and waterfall.[^ref-1][^ref-2] Each track features unique obstacles and hazards that add personality to the racing experience—dodge bombs from garden gnomes and an aggressive dog in the backyard, evade a sea monster on the mini-golf track, swirl between tombs in a haunted graveyard, or avoid lava surrounding an Aztec Pyramid.[^ref-9]

The career mode provides structured progression as players compete against fifteen opponents across circuits to earn money.[^ref-9] This economic element allows players to upgrade their vehicles and unlock additional content, creating a sense of advancement through the game's various challenges.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The game features a bird's-eye view perspective with pre-rendered graphics, presenting 2D, top-down viewed tracks where players control their RC cars in real-time.[^ref-2][^ref-10] Controls support keyboard, mouse, and various controllers, with Patch 1.1 addressing some joypad-related bugs from the original release.[^ref-10] The player maintains direct control over their vehicle at all times, navigating the tracks while managing powerups and avoiding obstacles.[^ref-10]

### Vehicle Selection and Customization

- **Baja Bug:** Balanced specifications

Players can customize their vehicles with upgrades to engines, shocks, and tires.[^ref-2] The Deluxe Traxxas Edition expanded customization options beyond the original release.[^ref-10] Patch 1.1 added the ability to apply custom paint jobs to vehicles.[^ref-10]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Neoseeker's Adam Byrant reviewed the game on November 23, 2000, awarding it a score of 78%.[^ref-2] The review acknowledged the game's nostalgic appeal, noting that "the ultimate Christmas present for any young child out there would have to be a radio controlled racecar" and praising the game for eliminating the "disappointing hourly charge-ups" of real RC cars.[^ref-2] However, Byrant identified significant issues with the audio design, stating "the biggest problem I had with this game was the sound. The music, announcer dialogue, and above all sound effects of the cars and powerups were the biggest turn-offs."[^ref-2] The review concluded that "RCR just doesn't come through in the lasting fun department, save for maybe the littler ones."[^ref-2]

The Collection Chamber retrospective offered mixed assessment, noting that "3D Ultra has always valued entertainment value over depth of gameplay, and the lack of variety really shows here. Moreso than any other in the series."[^ref-6] Despite this criticism, the review acknowledged "What is there is a lot of fun. I just wish there was more of it."[^ref-6]

### Modern Assessment

Modern gaming communities have expressed nostalgia for the title, with users on GOG.com's wishlist describing the game as a cherished childhood memory.[^ref-3] One user noted "The graphics, sounds and gameplay of this amazing piece of history must not be lost to time!"[^ref-3] The game has developed a cult following among fans who grew up with it, particularly in Germany where it was distributed as "Big Fun Funk Flitzer" via the Micky Maus-Magazin CD.[^ref-3]

**User Ratings:**
- **Old-Games.ru:** 7.0/10 (user rating)[^ref-11]

The game's historical significance has been reevaluated by some fans who credit it as an early innovator of car-soccer gameplay, a concept that would later achieve massive success with Rocket League.[^ref-8]

### Critical Perspective

3-D Ultra Radio Control Racers Deluxe: Traxxas Edition represents an interesting moment in casual gaming history, arriving at the cusp of the new millennium when budget-priced entertainment software was a significant market segment.[^ref-6] While the game received mixed reviews for its limited depth and repetitive sound design, it successfully captured the nostalgia of childhood RC car racing for a generation of young players.[^ref-2]

The game's legacy has been somewhat rehabilitated by modern retrospective analysis, particularly by fans who see its R/C soccer mode as a precursor to the car-soccer gameplay that would later make Rocket League a massive success.[^ref-8] This historical footnote, while perhaps overstated, demonstrates the game's creative approach to combining racing with arena-style combat modes. The 3-D Ultra series as a whole prioritized entertainment value over gameplay depth, and Radio Control Racers exemplified this philosophy—providing accessible, family-friendly fun even if experienced gamers found the experience shallow.[^ref-6]
