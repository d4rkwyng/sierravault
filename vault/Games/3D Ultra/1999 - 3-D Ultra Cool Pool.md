# 3-D Ultra Cool Pool

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 27, 2026</small>

## Overview

3-D Ultra Cool Pool is a billiards simulation game developed by [[Dynamix]] through [[Jeff Tunnell Productions]] and published by Sierra Attractions in 1999[^ref-3][^ref-2]. Marketed with the tagline "It's Pool with Attitude!", the game represented the ninth entry in Sierra's popular 3-D Ultra series of casual arcade-style games[^ref-3]. The series, created through the creative and commercial partnership between Dynamix and Sierra, was dedicated to carefree entertainment games where fun dominated above all else[^ref-4].

The game distinguished itself from traditional pool simulations by combining realistic physics with fantastical gameplay elements that could only exist in a video game[^ref-5]. While offering five classic billiards games on gorgeously-rendered tables, Cool Pool also featured five completely original "cool" games with specially shaped tables, exploding balls, and flying coins[^ref-6]. As one contemporary reviewer noted, "Sharp graphics, brilliantly modeled physics, and a pick up and play interface come together in a wonderful package"[^ref-7].

Cool Pool attempted to recreate the realities of billiards as faithfully as possible while taking full advantage of the three-dimensional environment[^ref-8]. The game supported online multiplayer with text-based chat during play, though Sierra shut down the public servers on August 16, 2007[^ref-3]. Community efforts through the "Online Forever" project at PAuth.com aimed to keep Cool Pool running online, though this service has since ceased operations[^ref-3].

## Story Summary

As a sports simulation game, 3-D Ultra Cool Pool does not feature a narrative storyline. The game focuses entirely on billiards gameplay across various game modes and table configurations. Players assume the role of a pool player competing in either single-player practice sessions or multiplayer matches against human opponents[^ref-9].

The game's premise centers on providing both authentic billiards experiences and creative fantasy variants that push the boundaries of what's possible on a pool table[^ref-6]. Players can customize their experience with standard balls or custom ball designs, selecting from various difficulty levels and game modes[^ref-10].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

3-D Ultra Cool Pool features a super-easy interface designed for accessibility[^ref-9]. The game utilizes pre-rendered tables rather than real-time 3D polygons, allowing for photorealistic wooden table surfaces with detailed textures[^ref-8][^ref-11]. Players can adjust their viewing angle and aim shots using keyboard and mouse controls, with the game requiring SVGA 800×600 resolution and Direct3D support[^ref-6].

A notable feature is the inclusion of a top-down mode similar to the look and feel of Yahoo Pool, providing players with familiar perspective options[^ref-12]. The game supports 1-4 players and can be played turn-based on the same PC for local multiplayer[^ref-5][^ref-9].

### Structure and Progression

The game is structured around two main categories of pool games[^ref-11]:

**Classic Games (5 modes):**
- **Eight Ball** – Traditional 8-ball rules with solids, stripes, and the 8-ball[^ref-9]
- **Nine Ball** – Sequential pocket game using balls 1-9[^ref-9]
- **Rotation** – Points-based game sinking balls in numerical order[^ref-6]
- **Cutthroat** – Three-player elimination game[^ref-9]
- **Classic Pocket Billiards** – Traditional billiards format[^ref-9]

**Cool Games (5 modes):**
- **24 Cents** – Each ball is assigned US currency value; first to get over 50 cents or exactly 24 cents wins[^ref-11]
- **Mad Bomber** – Balls count down from 3 when hit by the cue ball until they explode; highest score wins[^ref-11]
- **Chameleon Ball** – Balls start grey and change to the player's color when struck; high score game[^ref-11]
- **Poker** – Balls represent playing cards sent to the player's hand when pocketed; poker rules determine the winner[^ref-11]
- **Rocket Ball** – The most frenetic mode, featuring flashing rocket balls worth zero points that zoom across the table when hit[^ref-11]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The game's physics engine attempts to simulate realistic ball movement and collision dynamics[^ref-8]. Players must master traditional pool techniques including 45-degree bank shots and pinch kisses[^ref-6]. The cool games introduce unique mechanics impossible in real life, such as Chameleon balls that take on the color of the ball that strikes them, and explosive elements in Mad Bomber mode[^ref-5][^ref-6].

Special effects include exploding balls and flying coins on specially shaped tables that deviate from the traditional rectangular format[^ref-6]. Sound effects add to the atmosphere, including a scared girl screaming when a ball flies off the table[^ref-4].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

IGN's Scott Steinberg reviewed the enhanced successor Maximum Pool in 2000, giving it a score of 7.9/10 and noting that "you won't find a better simulation of the table sport on shelves, with the possible exception of Interplay's soon to be released Virtual Pool 3"[^ref-7]. The publication observed that "Sharp graphics, brilliantly modeled physics, and a pick up and play interface come together in a wonderful package"[^ref-7]. IGN staff commented, "We'll spare you the gratuitous 'ball' references and tell you that Sierra's pocketed another winner"[^ref-7].

GameSpot user DemonKyoto gave the game 7/10 in April 2005, calling it "A great pool representation" and noting that "The game does a great job of giving a realistic Pool experience, and comes with enough multiplayer and game choices to keep even non-serious pool players happy"[^ref-13]. Another GameSpot user, atticus443, praised it as the "Most realistic billiard game on the market as far as I'm concerned. Graphics are fantastic. I strongly recommend it"[^ref-13].

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospective assessments have been generally positive. My Abandonware users rate the game 4.67/5 based on 24 votes[^ref-12]. User laserbeak commented: "Wow this game is tons of fun, better than all those other Pool Sims I've been playing, it's even got topdown mode, which is similar to the look & feel of Yahoo Pool. Can't believe I've overlooked this all these years!!! Brilliant game, really grippingly addictive, & well polished, as you would expect from a Sierra Studios game"[^ref-12].

On Old-Games.RU, reviewer Sharp_ey gave a more critical assessment of 2/10, noting that "For a product created under the entertainment motto, the game excellently handles its tasks - to relax, to make smile, to create a feeling of comfort. But in no case should it be perceived as a serious simulator, otherwise disappointment is unavoidable"[^ref-4]. The Collection Chamber blog describes the game as maintaining the 3D Ultra series' "sly sense of fun with simple and entertaining gameplay"[^ref-11].

GOG.com wishlist user @etygofer praised the game's versatility: "For single player or with someone - it is turn-based on same PC. Classic game is known, but these variations are absolutely crazy and fun. For chill or for party. Played many hours. Always cool"[^ref-9].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **My Abandonware:** 4.67/5 (24 votes)[^ref-12]
- **GameSpot User Review:** 7/10[^ref-13]

## Development

### Origins

The 3-D Ultra series from the creative and commercial partnership of Dynamix and Sierra was dedicated to carefree games where entertainment dominated over all other considerations[^ref-4]. Cool Pool was conceived as the ninth entry in this popular casual gaming line, designed to bring the same accessible fun to billiards that earlier entries had brought to pinball and other arcade experiences[^ref-3].

### Production

Development was handled by Jeff Tunnell Productions, a studio closely associated with Dynamix[^ref-2]. The game was created under an entertainment-focused philosophy aiming to relax players, make them smile, and create a feeling of comfort[^ref-4]. The development team chose to use pre-rendered tables rather than real-time 3D polygon graphics, resulting in photorealistic wooden table surfaces that showcased the technology of the era[^ref-8][^ref-11].

- **Development Studio:** Jeff Tunnell Productions
- **Parent Developer:** Dynamix

### Technical Achievements

The game featured detailed pre-rendered graphics for its table surfaces, creating a photorealistic appearance that contemporary reviewers praised[^ref-8][^ref-11]. The physics engine was designed to simulate realistic ball movement and collision dynamics, earning praise as one of the more realistic billiards simulations available[^ref-13].

The game also pioneered online multiplayer for the 3-D Ultra series, allowing one-on-one play against other players with text-based chat during matches[^ref-3]. This online component operated through Sierra's game servers until their shutdown in 2007[^ref-3].

### Version History

| Version | Date | Platform | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| 1.0 | August 16, 1999 | Windows | Initial release[^ref-5][^ref-2] |
| 1.01 | Unknown | Windows | Official patch[^ref-12][^ref-14] |

### Technical Issues

The game's Internet play functionality ceased when Sierra shut down the public pool game servers on August 16, 2007[^ref-3]. Players may experience minor lag between turns during online play when using fan-maintained servers[^ref-13].

To restore online functionality, players must patch the game with a server fix available from fan preservation sites, which provides a Registry Key fix allowing Cool Pool (and Maximum Pool) to connect to new fan-made servers[^ref-2]. The game runs without issues on Windows 10 using the full rip version[^ref-12].

When running through DOSBox emulation (Daum build running Windows 95), users must shut down emulated Windows before exiting DOSBox to avoid errors, lost saves, and corrupt data[^ref-11].

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- The game includes unusual sound effects such as a scared girl screaming when a ball flies off the table[^ref-4]
- Chameleon balls physically change color when struck by another ball, an effect impossible in real-life pool[^ref-6]
- The "cool" games feature specially shaped non-rectangular tables unique to the computer game format[^ref-6]
- Maximum Pool (2000) was released as an enhanced version of Cool Pool with additional features[^ref-7]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

According to PriceCharting data, 3-D Ultra Cool Pool has maintained modest collector interest with approximately 6 loose copies sold on eBay between 2021-2024, representing roughly 1 sale per year[^ref-5]. The game continues to circulate through retro gaming retailers at prices around $5.99 for used complete-in-box copies[^ref-15].

### Collections

Cool Pool demos were included as bonus content with several Sierra products[^ref-10]:
- **3-D Ultra Pinball 5: Thrillride** – PC CD-ROM, US, version 1.0, fliptop box with flap
- **Hoyle Solitaire & Mahjong Tiles 2 (2000)** – PC/Mac CD-ROM, US, flip-top box
- **Incredible Machine: Contraptions (Return of the)** – PC CD-ROM, US, flip-top box with flap

### Fan Projects

The "Online Forever" project was started at PAuth.com to keep Cool Pool running online after Sierra's server shutdown[^ref-3]. While this official fan project has since shut down, community patches continue to allow the game to connect to player-hosted servers[^ref-3].

The game is preserved through various abandonware sites including My Abandonware (offering both 121 MB Full-Rip and 503 MB Disc Image versions)[^ref-12], the Internet Archive[^ref-6], and the Collection Chamber preservation project[^ref-11].

### Demo Distribution

A playable demo of approximately 15.6 MB was distributed, featuring Eight Ball and Chameleon Ball modes with single player and multiplayer with friend options[^ref-10]. The demo allowed custom balls, difficulty selection, name entry, and rules explanation, though it lacked settings changes and music[^ref-10].

### Critical Perspective

3-D Ultra Cool Pool represents an interesting intersection between serious sports simulation and casual arcade gaming that characterized late 1990s PC gaming. The 3-D Ultra series successfully carved out a niche for accessible, family-friendly gaming experiences during an era when many developers focused on increasingly complex and demanding titles[^ref-4].

The game's combination of realistic physics with fantastical game modes anticipated the casual gaming boom that would emerge in the 2000s. While it never achieved the status of dedicated billiards simulations like Virtual Pool, Cool Pool found its audience among players seeking lighter entertainment[^ref-7]. The fact that fan communities continue to maintain servers and preserve the game decades after release speaks to its enduring appeal among a dedicated player base[^ref-3][^ref-2].

## Series Continuity

3-D Ultra Cool Pool was the ninth game in Sierra's 3-D Ultra series of casual arcade games[^ref-3]. The series spanned multiple genres including pinball, miniature golf, NASCAR racing, and other sports and arcade titles. All games in the series shared a philosophy of prioritizing entertainment and accessibility over simulation depth[^ref-4].

An enhanced version called Maximum Pool was released in 2000, building upon Cool Pool's foundation with additional features and refinements[^ref-7]. Maximum Pool received a 7.9/10 from IGN and was praised as one of the better pool simulations available at the time[^ref-7].
