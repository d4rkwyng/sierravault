# 3-D Ultra Radio Control Racers

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

3-D Ultra Radio Control Racers, developed by Dynamix, Inc. and published by Sierra On-Line in 1999[^ref-1], was part of Sierra's budget-friendly 3-D Ultra series alongside titles like TrainTown and Cool Pool[^ref-2]. The game put players in control of radio-controlled toy cars racing across eight unique tracks featuring hidden shortcuts and interfering animated creatures[^ref-3].

As IGN noted in their contemporary review, this was "arcade style gaming at its very simplest -- grab your car, get on the road, and go"[^ref-4]. The game featured four different RC vehicle types including Monster Truck, Stadium Truck, Baja Bug, and Buggy, along with six special weapons and various customization options[^ref-3]. Despite its simplicity, the game garnered a dedicated fanbase and even influenced some players to pursue real-world RC car hobbies[^ref-5].

## Story Summary

Rather than featuring a traditional narrative, 3-D Ultra Radio Control Racers focused on pure arcade racing action with whimsical track themes. Players competed across diverse environments including a haunted graveyard, backyard complete with doghouse, plain dirt tracks, and mini-golf courses[^ref-1]. The game's marketing tagline captured its playful tone: "Objects in mirror are closer than they appear... and they just might eat you!"[^ref-2], while obstacles included "blobs of ectoplasm, angry Rottweilers, and sneaky lawn dwarfs"[^ref-7].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The game featured a semi-isometric overhead perspective that presented both 2D and 3D viewing options, with one reviewer describing it as taking "the approach of controlling car from above rather than [a] shrunk-down perspective"[^ref-8]. Players could control their vehicles using keyboard or various game controllers[^ref-8], though the perspective sometimes made corners difficult to judge during races—a common complaint in contemporary reviews[^ref-8]. The game supported both single-player racing and two-player split-screen multiplayer, though the two-player mode suffered from insufficient zoom-out causing frequent wall collisions, as the camera "doesn't zoom out enough causing wall-slamming"[^ref-3].

The control scheme was deliberately simplified to match the budget-friendly approach, with IGN observing that "this is arcade style gaming at its very simplest -- grab your car, get on the road, and go"[^ref-4]. While this accessibility appealed to casual players, enthusiasts noted that car customization effects were "barely visible during races" despite better rendering in the selection screen, with vehicles appearing like "fly on a screen" during actual gameplay[^ref-9].

### Structure and Progression

With only eight tracks available compared to competitors like Re-Volt's fifty-plus offerings[^ref-9], the game compensated with varied track designs and power-up systems. Players could choose from four distinct vehicle types—Monster Truck, Stadium Truck, Baja Bug, and Buggy—and customize their appearance with six different paint options[^ref-3]. The tracks featured diverse themes including a haunted graveyard, backyard complete with doghouse, plain dirt tracks, and mini-golf courses, each with unique obstacles and hidden shortcuts[^ref-1][^ref-3].

The game's marketing emphasized its whimsical nature with the tagline "Objects in mirror are closer than they appear... and they just might eat you!"[^ref-2]. Track obstacles were equally playful, featuring "blobs of ectoplasm, angry Rottweilers, and sneaky lawn dwarfs" as hazards players would encounter during races[^ref-7]. Despite the limited track count, the hidden shortcuts and animated creatures added replay value, though critics felt the game "will forever live in Re-Volt's shadow unless a sequel boosts its graphics and depth in a major way"[^ref-9].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The racing mechanics emphasized arcade-style action over simulation, featuring six special weapons and power-ups to gain competitive advantages[^ref-3]. The game included two difficulty levels and supported custom paint jobs through 128x128 24-bit BMP files[^ref-10]. A notable feature was the R/C Battle mode introduced in later versions, which included soccer and battle ball mini-games that some consider an early predecessor to games like Rocket League[^ref-11].

One user on the Steam Community noted that the game was "the innovator of car-soccer (like Rocket League)"[^ref-11], a claim that speaks to its lasting influence on vehicular sports games despite its budget origins. The game also featured various cheats, including a money cheat that only worked if the player name was set to "i cheat" (case insensitive)[^ref-10].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| IGN | 6.2/10 | "Standard budget fare"[^ref-4] |
| GameSpot | 7.1/10 | "Good" - Deluxe Traxxas Edition[^ref-8] |
| Critics Aggregate | 61% | MobyGames aggregate score[^ref-1] |

IGN's review was particularly critical, noting "The game reeks of simplicity, which is a shame, because with some added depth this could have been a plug-and-play game for all types of gamers"[^ref-4]. However, GameSpot's later review of the Deluxe Traxxas Edition was more positive, stating "While the graphics and sound could have been better, the fast-paced gameplay and circuit options make the game interesting and enjoyable"[^ref-8].

### Modern Assessment

User ratings have been more favorable than professional reviews, with My Abandonware users giving it 4.53/5 stars based on 74 votes[^ref-5]. Retrospective reviews acknowledge the game's limitations while appreciating its charm, with one reviewer noting it was "a hard game to review" because "while its graphics and depth aren't nearly as great as Re-Volt's, it has some strong points which still make it a fun game"[^ref-9]. The Collection Chamber blog observed that "3D Ultra has always valued entertainment value over depth of gameplay, and the lack of variety really shows here"[^ref-2].

## Development

### Origins

The game was developed by Dynamix, Inc. under the executive production of Jeffrey Tunnell, with Ken Embery as producer and Randy Thompson as project leader[^ref-1]. The development team was led by David McClurg as lead programmer and featured notable contributions from artists Danny Ngan and Jonathan Faton[^ref-1]. The overall artistic direction was handled by Jay Dee Alley with assistance from Doug Kelly[^ref-1]. The project was often described as "a low-budget version of Super Sprint," emphasizing accessible arcade-style gameplay over simulation depth[^ref-2].

### Production

As part of Sierra's 3-D Ultra budget series alongside titles like TrainTown and Cool Pool, the game was designed for broad appeal and accessibility within Sierra's "Attractions" casual gaming division[^ref-12]. The development utilized a directory structure at c:\rcracing\Dev\ and included extensive debugging features and developer messages in the executable[^ref-10]. The game featured pre-rendered graphics with a realistic art style and bird's-eye view perspective[^ref-13]. Developer messages hidden within the executable reveal personal touches, including "Hello Slugo" from John Leavens, "I love Victoria, Carly, Colin and Sierra" from Richard Gabrielson, and "Pure quality since 1993" from John Wolf[^ref-10].

Interestingly, the game was originally distributed in Germany with the Mickey Maus-Magazin as "Big Fun Funk Flitzer," expanding its reach to younger European audiences[^ref-10]. This alternate title reflected the game's family-friendly arcade appeal and Sierra's strategy for international distribution.

### Technical Achievements

The minimum system requirements included Windows 95 or NT 4.0, Intel Pentium 90 MHz processor, 32 MB RAM, 50 MB storage, and DirectX 6.1 compatible graphics[^ref-13]. The game supported various input devices including keyboard, mouse, and other controllers[^ref-1]. Technical issues included inverted colors problems and joypad bugs that were later addressed in patch version 1.1[^ref-13]. The full game installation required approximately 362 MB of disk space, while the ISO image totaled 452 MB[^ref-10].

### Version History

| Version | Date | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| 1.0 | 1999 | Original release[^ref-10] |
| 1.1 | October 25, 1999 | US patch - added bugoff cheat, custom vehicle skins (128x128 24-bit BMP), fixed joystick bug, corrected "fore" to "four" in Minigolf description[^ref-10] |
| 2.0 (Traxxas Edition) | 2000 | Add-on with 6 new tracks, R/C Battle mode including Soccer and Battle Ball minigames, controlled steering, wear & tear options[^ref-10][^ref-8] |
| Deluxe: Traxxas Edition | 2000 | Enhanced retail package combining original with Traxxas content[^ref-12] |

The v1.1 patch was essential for players seeking customization, allowing custom vehicle skins through 128x128 24-bit BMP files that could be applied to any of the four car types[^ref-10]. A notable bug fix addressed the issue where multiple human players using joysticks would experience control problems[^ref-13].

## Legacy

Despite its budget origins, 3-D Ultra Radio Control Racers maintained a dedicated following among RC racing game enthusiasts. One user credited the game as "the reason why I got into hobby grade rc cars"[^ref-5], demonstrating its surprising real-world influence on hobbyists. The game inspired genuine enthusiasm, with users expressing desire for modern rereleases—Steam community requests describe it as "still gold of these 3D Ultra series and an awesome RC game"[^ref-11], with one passionate player stating "I would kill for a sequel or reboot with new content"[^ref-5]. The game's car-soccer elements have been recognized as an early innovation in the genre that would later influence titles like Rocket League[^ref-11].

The game received several post-launch updates, including version 1.1 which added custom vehicle skins and fixed multiplayer bugs[^ref-10], and version 2.0 (Traxxas Edition) which added six new tracks and expanded R/C Battle modes[^ref-10]. Hidden content discovered by preservation enthusiasts revealed unused Simpsons character names (ai_Lisa, ai_Bart, ai_Marge, Homer) in the game files, along with debugging features and developer messages embedded in the executable[^ref-10]. Additionally, references to a desert race track and test race track exist in v1.0 but were never implemented, with the desert track only appearing in the v2.0 Traxxas Edition[^ref-10].

### Cut Content and Unused Features

Technical analysis by The Cutting Room Floor revealed several interesting discoveries in the game's files. A "zoomed out play option" was apparently teased in loading screens but never implemented in the final game[^ref-10]. Various debugging features were disabled in the retail release, and the directory structure suggests a more extensive development process than the final product might indicate[^ref-10]. These discoveries highlight the compressed development timeline typical of Sierra's budget game division.

### Cultural Impact

The game was used in unexpected contexts beyond entertainment—one user recalled it being "used in middle school classrooms as reward for good behavior"[^ref-5], demonstrating its appeal to younger audiences. The game was distributed with various PC magazines as a demo, and the German version "Funk-Flitzer" achieved particular popularity in European markets[^ref-10]. Though overshadowed by more ambitious RC racing games like Re-Volt, 3-D Ultra Radio Control Racers carved out its own niche as an accessible entry point to the genre.
