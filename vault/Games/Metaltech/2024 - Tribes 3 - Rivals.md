<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

Tribes 3: Rivals is a first-person shooter developed and published by Prophecy Games for Windows.[^ref-1] Released into Early Access on Steam on March 12, 2024, it is the latest entry in the Tribes franchise, originally created by Dynamix and Sierra Entertainment with [[1998 - Starsiege - Tribes|Starsiege: Tribes]].[^ref-2]

Built on Unreal Engine 5, Tribes 3: Rivals attempts to revive the classic Tribes formula of jet-pack enhanced multiplayer combat with an emphasis on high-speed movement and "skiing" mechanics.[^ref-2]

## Development

Prophecy Games, an independent studio, developed Tribes 3: Rivals as an attempt to revive the classic Tribes franchise that had been dormant since Tribes: Ascend (2012).[^ref-2] The game was built using Unreal Engine 5, representing a significant technical upgrade from previous entries.[^ref-1] Lead programmer Mick Larkins headed the development effort, with designer Erez Goren overseeing the gameplay vision.[^ref-1][^ref-12]

The development team focused on recreating the core Tribes experience while attracting both veterans and new players to the series.[^ref-5]

## Gameplay

### Core Mechanics

Tribes 3: Rivals preserves the signature gameplay elements that defined the original Dynamix-developed titles:[^ref-5]

- **Skiing:** The iconic movement system allowing players to slide down terrain at high speeds by holding a key while moving downhill[^ref-5]
- **Jet Packs:** Energy-limited aerial mobility for combat and traversal[^ref-5]
- **Spinfusors:** The series' signature disc-launching weapons requiring players to lead targets[^ref-5]
- **Capture the Flag:** The primary competitive mode requiring teams to steal the enemy flag while defending their own[^ref-5]

### Classes and Loadouts

Players can choose from three armor classes, each with distinct capabilities:[^ref-5]

- **Light:** Fast and agile, ideal for flag running
- **Medium:** Balanced combat capability
- **Heavy:** Slow but powerful, suited for defense

Six unique perks are available including "Doombringer" and "Sentinel" specializations.[^ref-5] Weapons include spinfusors, launchers, grenades, packs, shields, sniper rifles, pistols, shotguns, and the classic shocklance.[^ref-5]

### Maps and Modes

The game launched with seven maps: Katabatic, Wavemist, DryDock, Dangerous Crossing, Torment, Hollow, and RainDance.[^ref-5] Match formats include:[^ref-5]

- 16v16 Capture the Flag (CTF)
- Ranked 7v7 CTF
- Time trials
- Shooting range
- Custom matches with adjustable physics and settings
- Team Death Match on smaller arena maps (Honor Dome, Ice Dome, Magma Dome)

## Reception and Status

Tribes 3: Rivals launched into Early Access on March 12, 2024, but struggled to find an audience.[^ref-2] The game failed to reach a thousand concurrent players and has maintained only a few hundred active players at most times.[^ref-3]

On June 27, 2024, Prophecy Games posted an announcement on Steam stating that neither Tribes 3: Rivals nor their other title Starsiege: Deadzone "had enough success yet to support the studio."[^ref-4] The developer announced that updating the game would no longer be their main focus, effectively putting the title on indefinite hiatus.[^ref-4]

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Peak Players | Under 1,000[^ref-3] |
| Current Status | Development paused[^ref-4] |
| Steam Reviews | Mixed |
