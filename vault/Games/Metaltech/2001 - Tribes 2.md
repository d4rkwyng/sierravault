## Overview

Tribes 2 is a sci-fi first-person shooter multiplayer video game developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra Studios in 2001 as sequel to Starsiege: Tribes[^ref-1]. Set in the 40th century on the frontier 'wilderzone' of human space, hardy neo-barbarian tribes compete for possession of new worlds[^ref-2]. The game delivers fast-paced team-play online across vast worlds[^ref-3], with The Tribes of Man facing a new threat: The BioDerm Horde, genetically engineered as a slave race driving toward the heart of the Empire in an explosive frenzy of rage and violence[^ref-3].

Unlike anything before it, the multiplayer, 360 degree, team play-based game set new standards for what a multiplayer game could and possibly should be[^ref-4]. Tribes 2 gameplay makes extensive use of jet pack-powered flight, which adds a notable vertical element to combat[^ref-1], with players able to use jetpacks for aerial movement while wielding various weapons and equipment across large outdoor environments[^ref-5]. The game emphasizes team-based multiplayer gameplay with flexible role selection, supporting up to 64 players online or LAN[^ref-5].

## Story Summary

The game is set in the 40th century where humanity has spread across the galaxy into the frontier 'wilderzone' of human space[^ref-2]. Major factions include the Blood Eagle, Diamond Sword, Harbingers of Phoenix, Starwolf, and BioDerm Hordes[^ref-2]. The central conflict involves The Tribes of Man facing a new existential threat from The BioDerm Horde, a genetically engineered slave race that has broken free and now drives toward the heart of the Empire with the singular goal that humanity must perish[^ref-3]. This setup provides the backdrop for the large-scale multiplayer battles that define the game's core experience.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Tribes 2 is unlike any first person shooter you'll encounter, as it's mainly an online game focused on team-based multiplayer combat[^ref-11]. Players control jetpack-equipped infantry using keyboard and mouse controls, with gamepad/joystick support also available[^ref-5]. The game supports both first-person and third-person perspectives[^ref-5], allowing players to choose their preferred viewpoint for the fast-paced aerial combat.

### Structure and Progression

The game features multiple mission types including Capture the Flag (CTF), Capture and Hold (CnH), Hunters, Team Hunters, Bounty, Rabbit, Siege, and Deathmatch[^ref-14]. Tribes 2 delivers a unique and exciting brand of aerial, online mayhem that plays by complex rules and mechanics that are completely its own[^ref-15]. Games can support 2-32 players in standard modes, with some configurations supporting up to 64 players online[^ref-5]. The deep teamplay found in large matches is incredibly addicting and offers interesting opportunities to cobble together team strategies[^ref-16].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The game features three character classes, with 18 different armor types, over 50 weapon types, 11 grenade types, 9 mine types, 19 packs, and 25 deployable items[^ref-5]. Central to gameplay is the jetpack movement system, allowing players to "ski" across terrain and engage in aerial combat[^ref-7]. Vehicle gameplay adds another strategic layer, as one reviewer noted: "This isn't just a little infantry showdown any more, this is war"[^ref-19]. The game includes 18 different vehicles and 7 vehicle modules, enabling combined arms warfare across large outdoor maps[^ref-5].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Metacritic | 88/100 | Generally Favorable[^ref-20] |
| IGN | 8.9/10 | Professional review[^ref-21] |
| GameSpot | 8.5/10 (Great) | Comprehensive analysis[^ref-16] |
| PC Gamer US | 89/100 | June 2001 issue[^ref-22] |
| Eurogamer | 8/10 | Detailed review[^ref-19] |
| GameRevolution | 7/10 | Mixed reception[^ref-15] |

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospectives have been mixed, with MyAbandonware giving it 4.68/5[^ref-23] and the game maintaining active community support through projects like TribesNext[^ref-24]. Critics noted that "Tribes 2 isn't easy to master, and it won't play well on every gaming PC, but when you're up and running it's a tremendous amount of fun"[^ref-16]. The game has been described as "the best example of a team based multiplayer game to date"[^ref-25], though some criticized its steep learning curve and high system requirements[^ref-19].

## Development

### Origins

Development began as a sequel to Starsiege: Tribes, which came out at the very end of 1998 as the first retail first-person shooter designed specifically for multiplayer competition[^ref-16]. The game was announced in May 1998[^ref-7] and entered beta testing in August 2000, with approximately 1000 beta applicants selected[^ref-27]. Originally scheduled for Fall 2000 release[^ref-27], the game ultimately launched on March 29, 2001[^ref-28].

### Production

The development team included notable voice cast members Mark Berry, Kiamalise Budak, Jason Cottle, Andromeda Dunker, Craig English, Kit Harris, Jay Hopper, Kate Myre, Matt Reidy, and Kelly Wright[^ref-29]. The musical score was composed by Timothy Steven Clarke[^ref-30], with the complete soundtrack spanning 7 tracks and running 30:40 in total length[^ref-30].

Tragically, development was cut short when Sierra forced early release for Q2 profit reporting, and subsequently shut down Dynamix on August 10, 2001[^ref-32], just months after the game's launch. This closure shocked the gaming community, as one developer guide author noted: "While corporate America may not appreciate all you've done, the community always will"[^ref-11].

### Technical Achievements

Tribes 2 utilized a custom graphics engine evolved from Starsiege: Tribes technology[^ref-7], which would later become the foundation for the Torque Game Engine[^ref-34]. The game required substantial hardware for its time, with minimum requirements of a Pentium II 300 MHz, 64MB RAM, and 12MB 3D card[^ref-5]. Recommended specifications included at least a 600MHz Pentium III and a GeForce or Radeon graphics card[^ref-16]. The game featured high-quality 512x512 player models and supported both Direct3D 7 and OpenGL graphics APIs[^ref-5].

## Legacy

Tribes 2 had a profound impact on multiplayer gaming, with PC Gamer noting that "Tribes re-wrote the laws of online battle"[^ref-29]. The game's engine technology evolved into the Torque Game Engine, which was later released as open source and became Torque 3D[^ref-38]. Despite technical challenges at launch, the game maintained an active community, with over 300 servers hosting games worldwide[^ref-39].

The community created extensive modifications and content, including approximately 65 mods, multiple map packs, and more than 1000 scripts and utilities[^ref-40]. When Sierra discontinued official online support in 2008[^ref-41], the community developed TribesNext, a revival project that brought multiplayer functionality back online[^ref-24]. In 2024, Hi-Rez Studios made the entire Tribes series available for free to increase interest in their upcoming sequel[^ref-42].
