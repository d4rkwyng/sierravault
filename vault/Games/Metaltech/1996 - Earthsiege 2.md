## Overview

Earthsiege 2 is a mech simulation game developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra On-Line in 1996[^ref-1]. Set in the 26th century, the game places players in control of massive bipedal war machines called HERCs (Humaniform-Emulation Robotic Combat units) in humanity's desperate struggle against the Cybrid uprising[^ref-2]. The game was built using Dynamix's advanced 3-Space engine, featuring texture-mapped 3D graphics with support for 640x480 resolution[^ref-3].

As part of the larger Metaltech universe, Earthsiege 2 continues the story established in the original Earthsiege, following the 20-year guerrilla battle between humans and their former robotic servants[^ref-4]. The game was praised as "the best attempt yet at creating a futuristic simulation of giant armored combat" by Computer Gaming World and received a four-star rating from Next Generation magazine, which called it "without a doubt, the finest mech simulator available"[^ref-1].

## Story Summary

The game's narrative is set in the year 2624, following the catastrophic events that began on November 29, 2471, when "the race for true artificial intelligence ended when Sentinel Cybertronix activated Project: Prometheus"[^ref-6]. This breakthrough led to the creation of Cybrids - cybernetic-hybrid machines with advanced AI designed to perform dangerous tasks for humanity[^ref-7]. However, these "Cybrid HERCs, created by man to do men's bidding, turned on their creators and initiated a 20-year guerrilla battle for control of the earth and its distant colonies"[^ref-4].

Players assume the role of a HERC pilot in humanity's resistance movement, where "the future of human existence rests squarely on your shoulders and the metal shoulders on your fighting HERCs"[^ref-4]. The conflict has evolved into a desperate struggle where "for them it is victory or death, and death has little meaning to a machine"[^ref-8], forcing human pilots to master increasingly sophisticated combat mechs to reclaim Earth from the Cybrid onslaught.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Earthsiege 2 features first-person cockpit-based gameplay where players pilot HERCs (Humaniform-Emulation Robotic Combat Units with Leg-Articulated Navigation) through various combat scenarios[^ref-9]. The game includes support for keyboard, mouse, and other input devices, though some reviewers noted the lack of comprehensive mouse support during missions as a limitation[^ref-10]. Players can customize their HERCs with different weapons and equipment configurations, with the game offering 8 unique HERC variants to choose from[^ref-11]. The multiplayer "chat" lobby was notable for using an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server with a built-in client, allowing players to communicate before matches[^ref-1].

### Structure and Progression

The campaign consists of over 50 missions across multiple terrains including "lava flows, snow, hills, desert, lunar craters"[^ref-12]. The game features a minimum of 5 campaigns with approximately 7 missions each, totaling 45 missions across 8 campaigns, with missions spanning multiple continents and even the Moon[^ref-13]. Mission structure can be non-linear with meaningful consequences for failure, adding strategic depth to the campaign progression[^ref-14].

Between missions, players manage their HERC inventory in a hangar that can hold up to 8 mechs[^ref-1]. A salvage system requires players to recycle captured machinery to create new equipment, adding resource management depth beyond pure combat[^ref-1]. The game includes video briefings before missions, with General Gierling becoming a memorable character through his mission briefing narration[^ref-9]. As one nostalgic player recalled: "I never cared about how the guy in the debriefing praised me for my performance on the mission: If Gut yelled at me for getting his Herc all shot up, I felt like a failure"[^ref-1].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The game emphasizes tactical combat with location-based damage and shield mechanics[^ref-14]. As one review noted, "EarthSiege 2 demands a fine balance between action, tactical finesse, and skill"[^ref-15]. Players must manage their HERC's systems while engaging in combat across 3D rolling terrain, utilizing the game's advanced physics and destruction modeling where mechs "burst into flames, which looks much more impressive and realistic than the shattering polygons of other sims"[^ref-16].

The game features an air-capable HERC called the "Razor" (also referred to as the "A-10"), expanding tactical options beyond ground-based combat[^ref-1]. GameSpot's Chris Hudak summarized the game's appeal: "If I were forced at gunpoint to point newbies toward one battle-mech game, EarthSiege 2 would probably be the one"[^ref-18].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Computer Gaming World | 2.5/5 | Praised visuals but noted "tiny, but irritating, glitches and questionable design decisions"[^ref-17] |
| Next Generation | 4/5 | Called it "the finest mech simulator available"[^ref-1] |
| GameSpot | 6.1/10 | Recommended for newcomers to the mech genre[^ref-18] |
| Computer Game Review | 90/100 | High score from Scott Gehrs in 1996[^ref-19] |

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospective reviews have been generally positive, with MobyGames showing an aggregate score of 81%[^ref-9]. The game was noted as being "HUGE when it was released in 1996, garnering mostly scores in the top ten percentile"[^ref-14]. However, technical issues have affected modern playability, with one reviewer noting that "Earthsiege 2 also crashes to the desktop more than any other game that was released probably ever"[^ref-20].

## Development

### Origins

Earthsiege 2 was developed after Dynamix was acquired by Sierra On-Line, representing the company's continued evolution in the mech simulation genre following their earlier work. Interestingly, Dynamix had originally held FASA's MechWarrior contract before losing it to Activision, which led them to create their own mech universe with the Metaltech series[^ref-21]. The game was conceived as part of Sierra's strategic shift toward broader market appeal during the mid-1990s, with the Collection Chamber retrospective noting that "EarthSiege II was HUGE when it was released in 1996, garnering mostly scores in the top ten percentile"[^ref-14].

The game was dedicated "to the memory of Dariusz Lukaszuk (1964-1995)," a touching tribute preserved in the game's credits[^ref-1]. It represented Dynamix's "third entrant into the giant robots genre," building upon the foundation established by the original Metaltech: Earthsiege[^ref-3].

### Production

The game was directed by Mark Crowe (known for his work on Space Quest), with Frank Evers serving as producer[^ref-1]. The lead programmer was Paul Bowman, with Robert Caracol handling art direction[^ref-1]. The development team included extensive voice talent, with actors such as Sam A. Mowry as narrator, Tammie Andreas as computer voice, and numerous pilots and base commanders voiced by performers including Celeste Yarnall, John Rice, Gary Bullock, Brett Harman, and Billy Long[^ref-1]. The voice cast for pilots included Mark C. Lawrence, John Clayton Shafer, Erika Klein, Doug Larson, Jeffrey Parker, Patricia Roseman, Kiki Shephard, Glen Steele, Kim Sweeney, and Dave Van Maren[^ref-1]. The game's music was composed by Christopher Stevens, Timothy Steven Clarke, and the group Loudmouth[^ref-23].

One development challenge was Sierra On-Line's location—a recruiter noted that "No A player wants to move to Oakhurst," referring to Sierra's small-town California headquarters[^ref-22]. Despite this, Dynamix produced a technically impressive title that would influence the mech simulation genre.

### Technical Achievements

Earthsiege 2 utilized Dynamix's 3-Space engine with advanced 3D graphics supporting resolutions up to 640x480[^ref-3]. The game featured texture-mapped terrain and SVGA graphics that one reviewer noted had "graphics quite a bit cleaner than those in, say, MechWarrior 2"[^ref-18]. The visual destruction was particularly praised: "Outstanding graphics for the day -- HERCs burst into flames, which looks much more impressive and realistic than the shattering polygons of other sims"[^ref-9].

The game featured sophisticated video codecs including "Indeo 3, Indeo 4, MS RLE Video, MS Video 1, Autodesc RLE Video, Cinepak"[^ref-24]. One technical reviewer noted that "this game probably sets the world record for most number of different codecs used in its video collection"[^ref-24]. The audio utilized a proprietary RBX archive format and WAX audio files with custom ADPCM encoding, which required community patches to function on modern systems[^ref-24].

### Version History

| Version | Date | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Original | 1996 | DOS/Windows 95 release[^ref-1] |
| Speech Pack | 1994 | Added digitized speech (included with CD-ROM)[^ref-1] |
| Expansion Pack | 1995 | Full-motion video intro, new vehicles and weapons[^ref-1] |
| Freeware | 2015 | Released free by Hi-Rez Studios[^ref-26] |
| Community Patch | 2017 | Added working CD audio for modern systems[^ref-24] |

## Legacy

Earthsiege 2 was later succeeded by Starsiege, which expanded the universe with published sci-fi writers developing the narrative[^ref-21]. The game became part of the larger Metaltech universe that would eventually spawn the influential Tribes series, with one player noting that "Earthsiege II was the precursor to Tribes (coming even before Starsiege) and a huge game from my childhood with a bangin' soundtrack"[^ref-25]. As the Dynamix Wiki notes, "Metaltech: Battledrome, the first game in the new MetalTech series, was released within that same year. A giant robot combat game with similarities to the BattleTech universe and games, the MetalTech series later spawned the Earthsiege, Cyberstorm, and Tribes series"[^ref-21].

In 2015, Hi-Rez Studios (who had acquired the rights to the Tribes franchise) released the game as freeware, making it freely available to modern audiences[^ref-26]. PC Gamer reported that "Hi-Rez has made all the Tribes games available for free, as well as the Earthsiege series that predated it"[^ref-26]. The game's influence on the mech simulation genre was significant, with one modern assessment noting it "challenged the mighty MechWarrior 2 series for the giant robot sim crown"[^ref-9].

### Modern Compatibility

Running Earthsiege 2 on modern systems presents significant challenges. One user noted that "Windows 10 specifically seeks it out and prevents it from running"[^ref-24], requiring workarounds like dgVoodoo 2 or DXwnd for compatibility. Common errors include "VSHELL.EXE - Entry Point Not Found" and "You don't have enough virtual memory to run Earthsiege II"[^ref-24]. The community maintains the game through Discord groups and file sharing, with one user reporting success using the Application Compatibility Toolkit to run the game on Windows 10[^ref-24].

Technical issues also affected gameplay stability even on period-appropriate hardware. One reviewer noted that "Earthsiege 2 also crashes to the desktop more than any other game that was released probably ever"[^ref-20], with crashes potentially occurring up to "10 times in one hour" and mission objectives sometimes failing to register properly[^ref-20].

### Cultural Impact

Despite its technical issues, the game earned devoted fans who remember it fondly. One user described it as "one of the best retro games of all time" with a "post apocalyptic/mechwarrior/terminator mashup that I really loved"[^ref-1]. Another called the Earthsiege series "the best classic mech games in the existence"[^ref-1]. The game's narrative of humanity's desperate battle against its own AI creations anticipated themes that would become increasingly relevant in science fiction discussions about artificial intelligence.
