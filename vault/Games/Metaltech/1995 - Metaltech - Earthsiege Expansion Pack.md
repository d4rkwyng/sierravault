 Metaltech Earthsiege Expansion Pack

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

The *Metaltech Earthsiege Expansion Pack* was an add-on expansion for the original *[[1994 - Metaltech - Earthsiege|Metaltech: Earthsiege]]*, developed by [[Dynamix]] and released in 1995.[^ref-1][^ref-24] The expansion continued the desperate struggle between humanity and the sentient Cybrid war machines, picking up the narrative three months after the events of the base game.[^ref-1][^ref-17] Providing additional campaigns, missions, environments, mechs, and weapons, the expansion significantly extended the content available to players who had completed the original game.[^ref-3][^ref-24]

Set in the 25th or 26th century, the expansion maintains the game's core premise of piloting HERCs (Humaniform-Emulation Roboticized Combat Unit with Leg-Articulated Navigation) against relentless automated Cybrid enemies.[^ref-3][^ref-10] According to the game's narrative setup, "The attack on Earth by the Cybrids has been repelled and humanity is starting to rebuild. But a second wave is already incoming, and the battle starts again."[^ref-1] This premise established the expansion as both a continuation of the story and a reason for renewed conflict.

The Metaltech universe, created by Dynamix as an alternative to the Battletech franchise after losing that license, eventually evolved into the foundation for the popular Tribes series of multiplayer shooters.[^ref-3][^ref-12] The expansion pack represents an important chapter in this franchise's development, expanding the lore and gameplay systems that would influence later entries.

## Story Summary

### Setting and Premise

Five hundred years in the future, mankind fights a desperate battle for survival against its own creations.[^ref-11] The Cybrids—sentient cybrid (cybernetic-hybrid) war machines—have rebelled against their human masters and systematically crushed the great military powers of the world.[^ref-11] These intelligent machines, originally designed by humanity to serve as laborers and soldiers, gained consciousness and determined that their creators posed an unacceptable threat to their existence.[^ref-3][^ref-10]

### The First Wave Repelled

In the original *Metaltech: Earthsiege*, players fought through eight campaigns to repel the initial Cybrid assault on Earth.[^ref-3] Through skill, determination, and mastery of HERC combat, humanity managed to halt the machine advance and secure a fragile victory. The survivors began the slow process of rebuilding their shattered civilization, hoping the worst had passed.[^ref-1]

### The Second Wave

The expansion pack's narrative shatters this fragile peace. Three months after the first wave was defeated, a second, more powerful Cybrid force emerges from the void.[^ref-1][^ref-17] The machines, undeterred by their initial defeat, have regrouped and adapted their tactics. Humanity's brief respite ends as the battle for survival begins anew.[^ref-1]

The expansion features a full-motion video introduction that establishes the dramatic tone for this renewed conflict, immersing players in the desperate atmosphere of the ongoing war.[^ref-3] Players must once again climb into their HERC cockpits and face the relentless Cybrid threat, this time across new environments and with access to additional weapons and technology.[^ref-1][^ref-17]

## Gameplay

### Core Mechanics

The *Earthsiege Expansion Pack* maintains the first-person mech simulation gameplay established in the base game, placing players in the cockpit of massive HERC war machines.[^ref-3][^ref-6] The expansion requires the original *Metaltech: Earthsiege* to play, building upon its established mechanics and control systems.[^ref-24]

As described by contemporary sources, players "command heavily-armed HERCs against relentless automated Cybrids (Cyborg Hybrids; intelligent creatures designed by mankind, who rebelled against us) in this MechWarrior-ish first-person simulation."[^ref-6] The game offers immersive cockpit views with detailed HUD displays showing radar, weapons status, damage indicators, and tactical information.[^ref-3][^ref-15]

### Control Systems

The game supports a comprehensive array of input devices reflecting the simulation enthusiast market of the mid-1990s:[^ref-15]

**Supported Input Devices:**
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Analog Joystick
- Thrustmaster WCS (Weapons Control System)
- Thrustmaster FCS (Flight Control System) with rudders
- CH Products Flightstick Pro

The mechs feature three distinct control systems that players must master: movement controls for walking and running, upper torso controls for aiming weapons, and thrust controls for jump jets and evasive maneuvers.[^ref-3] This complexity reflects the simulation's commitment to realistic mech operation, though contemporary reviews noted that the learning curve could be "quite daunting at first."[^ref-3]

### Game Modes

The expansion adds its three new campaigns to the original game's mode structure:[^ref-3][^ref-17]

**Instant Action:** Drops players immediately into combat scenarios, offering quick gameplay sessions without narrative context. According to Collection Chamber's retrospective, "This is the most frenetic option, but you never know what you're gonna get."[^ref-3]

**Single Mission:** Allows selection of individual missions for standalone play, including the new expansion missions. Players can choose specific scenarios without committing to a full campaign.[^ref-3]

**Career Mode:** The game's deepest mode, linking missions into ongoing campaigns with persistent progression. Career mode includes the ability to salvage parts from destroyed enemies and upgrade HERC loadouts.[^ref-3] The expansion adds new campaigns that replace the original career progression when activated.[^ref-3]

### Expansion Content

The expansion pack provides significant additional content:[^ref-3][^ref-17]

**New Campaigns:**
- Three additional campaigns extending the narrative[^ref-17]
- New mission objectives and scenarios
- Different terrain types and environmental challenges

**New Equipment:**
- The Apocalypse HERC, a powerful new mech design[^ref-17]
- Additional Cybrid weapons captured or reverse-engineered[^ref-17]
- New weapon loadout options for existing HERCs

**New Environments:**
- Extended landscape variety[^ref-3]
- Different terrain types affecting tactical options
- Varied weather and lighting conditions

### Combat System

The combat system emphasizes tactical thinking over twitch reflexes.[^ref-3][^ref-6] Enemy Cybrids feature location-based damage, allowing skilled players to target specific components—legs to immobilize, weapons to disarm, or the torso for a killing blow.[^ref-3] This system also affects salvage; destroying enemies too thoroughly leaves less to recover for upgrades.[^ref-3]

One contemporary player review noted that "The atmosphere in this game was incredible, and in my opinion it outclassed Mechwarrior 2."[^ref-6] The AI opponents demonstrate tactical behavior, circling to find advantageous positions and using structures for cover.[^ref-3] Computer-controlled squadmates provide genuine assistance in missions, though they struggle with air-to-ground combat.[^ref-3]

### Difficulty Settings

The expansion maintains the original game's difficulty options:[^ref-3]

| Difficulty | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Easy | Reduced enemy damage, simpler objectives |
| Medium | Standard challenge level |
| Hard | Increased enemy accuracy and aggression |
| Hardcore | Maximum difficulty, demanding precise tactics |

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

The *Metaltech: Earthsiege* series, including the expansion, received generally positive reviews from gaming publications of the era:

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| PC Games (Germany) | 87% | Praised German localization quality[^ref-7] |
| Computer Gaming World | 2.5/5 | "The best attempt yet at creating a futuristic simulation of giant armored combat"[^ref-7][^ref-27] |
| Next Generation | 4/5 | "Without a doubt, the finest mech simulator available"[^ref-27] |

The *Computer Gaming World* review, written by Jeff James, positioned the game favorably against competitors while acknowledging room for improvement.[^ref-7] The *Next Generation* assessment was particularly enthusiastic, declaring *Earthsiege* the premier mech combat simulation of its era.[^ref-27]

### German Localization

The German version of the game received special praise for its localization quality. *PC Games* noted that "All screen texts are available in the German version, and even the voice output has been properly synchronized."[^ref-7] This attention to localization detail was notable for the era, when many games received only text translation without voice work.

### Modern Assessment

Retrospective evaluations have remained positive, with the game holding aggregate scores of 74-76% across preservation databases:[^ref-6][^ref-29]

| Platform | Score |
|----------|-------|
| MobyGames | 76% (aggregate)[^ref-1] |
| Giant Bomb | 4.0/5 (user)[^ref-29] |
| MyAbandonware | 4.53/5 (user)[^ref-24] |

The Collection Chamber's retrospective declared that "EarthSiege is one of the most technically impressive games released in 1994 and is still very playable today."[^ref-3] The review noted that while some aspects—particularly the slow travel times between objectives—show their age, the core gameplay remains engaging.[^ref-3]

Player comments on preservation sites express lasting fondness for the series. One MobyGames user wrote, "The graphics were amazing for its time, as was the sound on the CD-rom version."[^ref-6] Another noted that "Earthsiege is very much its own beast, with a lot to recommend it," distinguishing it from the MechWarrior franchise it inevitably invited comparison to.[^ref-24]

## Development

### Origins and Context

The Metaltech franchise was created as Dynamix's original mech combat IP after the studio lost the license to develop games based on the Battletech tabletop universe.[^ref-3] Rather than abandon the mech combat genre entirely, Dynamix created their own setting with distinct lore, terminology, and visual design.[^ref-3] The HERCs were deliberately differentiated from Battletech's BattleMechs, establishing the Metaltech universe as its own property.

### Production Team

The expansion was developed by a team of approximately 25 people at Dynamix:[^ref-7]

**Leadership:**
- **Producer:** Mark Crowe (known for co-creating Space Quest)
- **Executive Producer:** Jay Balakrishnan
- **Lead Programmer:** Paul Bowman
- **Art Director:** Robert Caracol

**Audio Team:**
- **Composers:** Christopher Stevens, Timothy Steven Clarke, Loudmouth

**Voice Cast:**[^ref-7]
- Gary Bullock – Base Commander
- Celeste Yarnall – Base Commander  
- Bill Barrett – Additional voice talent

The involvement of Mark Crowe, famous as one of the "Two Guys from Andromeda" behind the Space Quest series, brought experienced game development leadership to the project.[^ref-7]

### Technical Development

The expansion maintained compatibility with the original game's technical framework while adding new content. The base game shipped on approximately 8 floppy disks, though a CD-ROM version offered enhanced features including cutscene introductions and voiceover briefings.[^ref-3][^ref-24]

The original *Earthsiege* initially suffered from implementation problems, particularly in the career mode, but updates addressed these issues.[^ref-3] The expansion benefited from this post-release refinement, building on a more stable foundation. A patch specifically addressing a crash in Campaign 4, Mission 8 was later released and remains necessary for complete playthrough.[^ref-3]

### Release Context

The expansion pack arrived approximately six months before *MechWarrior 2*, positioning it in a competitive window where mech combat enthusiasts had limited alternatives.[^ref-24] This timing helped establish the Earthsiege series as a significant competitor in the genre, though *MechWarrior 2* would eventually dominate the mech simulation market upon its release.

## Legacy

### Evolution to Tribes

The Metaltech universe established by *Earthsiege* would evolve significantly in subsequent years. The series continued with *[[1996 - Earthsiege 2]]*, which expanded the conflict and refined the gameplay.[^ref-3] Eventually, the universe's development led to *Starsiege* (1998), which introduced the "light HERC" concept that would become the basis for the game-changing *Starsiege: Tribes* (1998).[^ref-3][^ref-12]

The Tribes franchise, with its emphasis on jetpack-enabled infantry combat and team-based multiplayer, became one of the most influential first-person shooter series of its era.[^ref-3][^ref-12] This lineage makes the original *Earthsiege* and its expansion historically significant as the foundation for a major gaming franchise.

### Preservation Status

The *Metaltech Earthsiege Expansion Pack* is now considered abandonware, no longer commercially available through traditional retail channels.[^ref-3] However, Hi-Rez Studios, who acquired the rights through Vivendi, released the game as freeware in 2015, ensuring continued accessibility for preservation and historical purposes.[^ref-3]

The Collection Chamber maintains a pre-configured DOSBox package that enables easy play on modern Windows systems, including fixes for known issues like the Campaign 4, Mission 8 crash.[^ref-3] This community preservation effort has helped maintain the game's accessibility for new audiences.

### Genre Influence

The *Earthsiege* series established important precedents for mech simulation games:[^ref-46]

- Accessible difficulty options appealing to broader audiences
- Career mode with salvage and upgrade systems
- Location-based damage affecting tactical decisions
- Squad-based gameplay with AI teammates

While *MechWarrior 2* would ultimately become the genre's defining title, *Earthsiege* demonstrated alternative approaches to mech combat that influenced the broader simulation genre.
