## Overview

Metaltech: Earthsiege is a mech combat simulation game released by Dynamix in 1994.[^ref-1] Set five hundred years in the future, the game depicts mankind's desperate battle for survival against sentient cybrid war machines that have rebelled against their human creators and crushed the great military powers of the world.[^ref-2] Players command giant bipedal war machines called HERCs (Humaniform-Emulation Roboticized Combat Unit with Leg-Articulated Navigation) in first-person combat against these relentless automated enemies.[^ref-3]

Described as "the best attempt yet at creating a futuristic simulation of giant armored combat" by Computer Gaming World[^ref-4], Earthsiege was the first game in what would become an expansive universe including sequels, strategy games, and eventually the Tribes series.[^ref-5] The game was particularly noted for being "one of the most technically impressive games released in 1994" and remains "very playable today."[^ref-6] Dynamix, described as "the most consistent of Sierra's subsidiary studios," delivered Metaltech: EarthSiege as one of their solid performers in non-adventure games during 1994.[^ref-7]

While MechWarrior and the BattleTech series had established the mech combat genre five years earlier, many players found Dynamix's Metaltech universe to be superior despite being "an obvious rip-off name."[^ref-6] The game established conventions and gameplay mechanics that would influence mech simulations for years to come.

## Story Summary

The game's narrative centers around the catastrophic rebellion of artificial intelligences called Cybrids.[^ref-8] Prometheus, a prototype cybernetic-hybrid machine, was the first Cybrid created by humanity.[^ref-8] As the backstory explains, "We created Cybrids with breakthrough AI to perform dangerous tasks with lightning precision. But we should never have taught them to fight."[^ref-9] The Cybrids turned against their human masters and initiated a 20-year guerrilla battle that has devastated human civilization.[^ref-10]

Set in the year 2829, the conflict has brought Earth to the brink of extinction as these intelligent machines wage relentless war against humanity.[^ref-11] The central premise warns that "whoever controlled the Cybrids would control the world"—but the Cybrids now control themselves.[^ref-11] The machines fought both as individuals and as coordinated teams, all united in their goal of human annihilation.[^ref-12]

Players take the role of HERCULAN warriors who must navigate this target-rich wasteland to deliver heavily mechanized payback against the Cybrid forces.[^ref-9] The resistance is humanity's last hope, and players must prove themselves worthy of piloting increasingly powerful HERCs through a campaign that spans multiple theaters of war. The narrative unfolds through mission briefings and debriefings, with the stakes escalating as players progress deeper into Cybrid-controlled territory.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Earthsiege features first-person 3D graphics from the cockpit perspective of the HERCs.[^ref-13] The mechs, known as HERCULANs or HERCs, are gigantic imposing metal beasts, and the in-game HUD definitely reflects their massive scale.[^ref-6] Each of the different HERCs comes with its own HUD, with different layouts, but ultimately they all consist of the same essential information: radar, weapons displays, damage indicators, and navigation data.[^ref-6]

The game supports various input devices including keyboard, mouse, analog joystick, and specialized flight controllers like the Thrustmaster WCS, FCS and rudders, and Flightstick Pro.[^ref-14] Players command giant HERCs in head-to-head combat over network/modem or against computer-controlled opponents.[^ref-1] The wealth of information given to the player at once can be quite daunting at first, but players eventually become comfortable with interpreting the complex cockpit displays.[^ref-6]

### Mech Control Systems

These hunks of metal have three different areas to control: the movement, the upper torso, and the thrust.[^ref-6] In the heat of battle, it's easy to get discombobulated by the controls, but with practice they can be mastered. The cockpit perspective provides detailed dashboard information that players need to monitor closely, including fuel gauge, oil pressure gauge, tachometer, oil temperature gauge, and water temperature gauge if they have any desire to finish the race in one piece.[^ref-8]

The keyboard-based aiming can be imprecise, which is particularly noticeable given that enemies feature location-based damage.[^ref-6] This makes targeting specific components on enemy mechs a skill that requires practice to master.

### Structure and Progression

The game features a campaign mode with persistent squad mates, mechs, salvaging, mech construction, and damage systems.[^ref-15] Right from the off, there are three modes of play: Instant Action lands players straight in the middle of a warzone; Single Mission allows selection from a number of levels for a single playthrough; while Career mode pieces missions together into an ongoing story with the added bonus of scavenging for parts and upgrading mechs.[^ref-6]

Players can customize and configure their HERC loadouts with different weapons and equipment.[^ref-16] The combat takes place across multiple locations including North America, South America, Antarctica, and Asia.[^ref-16] The game's structure allows for both single-player campaigns and multiplayer combat via IPX and modem connections.[^ref-14]

### Combat and Tactics

The most impressive aspect of Earthsiege was its AI system, described as allowing players to "imagine tactical thoughts going through your opponent's minds" despite being from 1994.[^ref-6] The Cybrid enemies will circle around players to get into the best position or hide around structures to escape fire.[^ref-6] This level of tactical intelligence was remarkable for its time and contributed significantly to the game's immersive combat experience.

The Cybrid enemies feature location-based damage systems, adding tactical depth to combat engagements.[^ref-16] Players can target specific limbs, weapons, and torso sections of enemy mechs, with each component being destroyable independently. However, depending on where hits land, there may not be much left to salvage for the player or their squad mates.[^ref-6]

Player squad mates are also more help than hindrance. Players can quite possibly survive a mission by letting their team do all the shooting, though they're noted as being useless at ground-to-air combat.[^ref-6] The ability to command AI wingmen adds strategic depth and allows players to approach missions with different tactical approaches.

One criticism of the combat is the significant amount of walking between combat encounters. The speed of mechs is quite slow, which is good when aiming shots but not so good for dodging them.[^ref-6] Traveling to checkpoints can be tedious, with players sometimes finding nothing but a single building at a waypoint, meaning another hike before seeing combat again. The recommendation for more action is to start on higher difficulty settings.[^ref-6]

### Salvage and Customization

Career mode includes a salvaging mechanic where players can recover components from destroyed enemies to upgrade their own mechs.[^ref-6] This adds an RPG-like progression element where strategic decisions about which enemies to target and how to destroy them can impact the resources available for mech improvement. Managing the salvage effectively becomes key to building a powerful HERC for later missions.

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Next Generation | 4/5 | Called it "Without a doubt, the finest mech simulator available"[^ref-4] |
| PC Games | 87% | Praised the German localization in July 1995[^ref-17] |
| Critics Average | 74% | Based on contemporary reviews[^ref-1] |

Initial reviews at the time were somewhat mixed, with the game suffering from many problems including a badly implemented career mode.[^ref-6] However, once updates arrived, these issues subsided. A later expansion pack that added extra environments, missions, and mechs beefed up the game even more, addressing many of the initial criticisms.[^ref-6]

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospective reviews have been generally positive, with MyAbandonware giving it 4.53/5[^ref-18] and 4.5/5.[^ref-15] MobyGames users rated it 62% overall[^ref-1], while another MobyGames listing shows 5.0/5.[^ref-19] GameFAQs users rated it as "Good" based on 9 ratings.[^ref-9]

Player opinions remain divided on how Earthsiege compares to its primary competitor. Some users felt it "looked, played and felt like a poor man's Mechwarrior,"[^ref-15] while others praised that "the atmosphere in this game was incredible, and in my opinion it outclassed Mechwarrior 2."[^ref-1] One player noted that "Earthsiege is the game that made me upgrade from a 486 DX4-100 to a Pentium 90 and it was well worth it,"[^ref-23] demonstrating the game's technical impressiveness and the dedication of its fanbase.

The Collection Chamber retrospective concludes that "EarthSiege is one of the most technically impressive games released in 1994 and is still very playable today,"[^ref-6] a sentiment that reflects the game's enduring appeal among mech simulation enthusiasts.

## Development

### Origins

Metaltech: Earthsiege was developed by Dynamix after they lost the Battletech license and created their own Metaltech Universe.[^ref-6] The game followed Metaltech: Battledrome, which was the first game in the Metaltech series and established the foundation for what would later spawn the Earthsiege, Cyberstorm, and Tribes series.[^ref-5] This decision to create an original universe rather than license an existing property gave Dynamix creative freedom to develop their own lore and gameplay mechanics.

The development team was led by designers David Selle, Mark Crowe, and Tim Gift.[^ref-3] Mark Crowe was already well-known at Sierra for his work on the Space Quest series as one half of the "Two Guys from Andromeda," bringing significant game design experience to the project.

### Production

The game featured voice acting from several performers, including Andre Rosey Brown as the Service Bay Technician, John Rice as Base Commander #1, Gary Bullock as Base Commander #2, Celeste Yarnall as Base Commander #5, and Ericka Klein as Pilot #1.[^ref-20] This voice cast brought the game's military setting to life through briefings and in-mission communications.

The musical score was composed by Christopher Stevens, Timothy Steven Clarke, and the group Loudmouth.[^ref-21] The audio design contributed significantly to the game's atmosphere, with sound effects and music creating an immersive combat experience.

In 1995, an expansion pack was released featuring a full-motion video introduction, new vehicles and weapons.[^ref-22] The expansion missions were far more diverse than the original campaign, though they were structured similarly with the standard waypoint-destroy-repeat pattern.[^ref-6] Access to the expansion content required toggling an option in the menu, which would basically reset the game with the new career mode replacing the old, with separate save files meaning salvaged weapons could not be carried over.[^ref-6]

### Technical Achievements

Built on the 3-Space engine[^ref-3], Earthsiege was noted for its impressive graphics and sound, particularly in the CD-ROM version.[^ref-1] The 3-Space engine was Dynamix's proprietary technology that powered many of their 3D games during this era, and it proved well-suited to the demands of mech combat simulation.

The game required an Intel i386 DX33 processor minimum, 4 MB RAM, and MS-DOS 5.0 or greater.[^ref-14] It supported various sound cards including Sound Blaster, Pro Audio Spectrum, AdLib, Gravis Ultra Sound, Ensoniq SoundScape, and General MIDI.[^ref-14] This broad hardware support ensured the game could reach a wide audience of PC gamers.

One player noted that "Earthsiege is the game that made me upgrade from a 486 DX4-100 to a Pentium 90 and it was well worth it,"[^ref-23] demonstrating the game's technical demands and the value players placed on optimal performance.

### Version History and Patches

The game received updates that addressed initial problems with the career mode.[^ref-6] A Campaign 4, Mission 8 crash issue was identified and fixed through a patch available from Sierra Help, requiring players to replace the DBSIM.EXE file in the MTECH folder.[^ref-6] Modern preservation efforts recommend running the game at around 74000 DOSBox cycles (equivalent to a Pentium 120) for proper speed.[^ref-6]

## Legacy

### Franchise Expansion

Earthsiege established the foundation for an extensive game universe. The immediate sequel, EarthSiege II, was "HUGE when it was released in 1996, garnering mostly scores in the top ten percentile."[^ref-24] The Metaltech universe eventually expanded to include:

- **Metaltech: Battledrome** (1994) - Arena combat prequel
- **Earthsiege 2** (1996) - Direct sequel with enhanced graphics and gameplay
- **Cyberstorm** (1996) - Turn-based strategy spinoff
- **Cyberstorm 2: Corporate Wars** (1998) - Strategy sequel
- **Starsiege** (1999) - Mech combat continuation
- **Tribes** series - The Metaltech universe's most successful spinoff, launching the multiplayer FPS Tribes franchise

### Industry Impact

The game was released during a transitional period for Sierra On-Line when the company was shifting its product development strategy.[^ref-6] Dynamix, as a Sierra subsidiary, demonstrated that the company could succeed with genres beyond their traditional adventure game strength.

The Metaltech series pioneered many conventions in mech combat games, including detailed cockpit interfaces, squad-based tactical combat, and extensive customization systems. The series' influence can be seen in subsequent mech games that adopted similar approaches to pilot immersion and vehicle management.

### Cultural Legacy

The game represents an important chapter in the evolution of mech combat simulations on PC. While MechWarrior may have established the genre, Earthsiege offered a compelling alternative with its own distinct universe, gameplay mechanics, and atmosphere. The devotion of its fanbase, some of whom upgraded their hardware specifically to play the game, speaks to its impact on players during the mid-1990s.

### Preservation Status

The game has been preserved and made playable on modern systems through the efforts of the retro gaming community. The Collection Chamber has created a custom installer using DOSBox DAUM that brings the game to modern systems, with the manual, reference card, and expansion pack included.[^ref-6] Version 2 of this preservation package (released January 27, 2023) fixed the Campaign 4, Mission 8 crash issue and improved the installer package.[^ref-6]
