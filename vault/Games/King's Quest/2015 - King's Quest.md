## Overview
King's Quest is a 2015 episodic adventure game developed by The Odd Gentlemen and published by [[Activision]] under the revived Sierra Entertainment brand for Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One[^ref-1][^ref-3][^ref-13]. Released in five chapters between July 2015 and October 2016, the game reimagines the classic King's Quest franchise, featuring an elderly King Graham narrating his youthful adventures to his granddaughter Gwendolyn[^ref-1][^ref-3]. The entire game is told as a flashback, similar to the story structure of King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride, set in a fantasy universe and with a humorous tone[^ref-3]. IGN called it "a beautiful experiment in resurrecting the conventions of gaming's past and dressing them up in the lush graphics available today" and awarded it 8/10[^ref-9]. The game received an "Excellent" 4.5/5 rating from Adventure Gamers, who called it "an instant classic" and recommended that "wise, brave, and compassionate adventurers alike should definitely consider having a crack at it"[^ref-6].

## Story Summary
The narrative of King's Quest (2015) unfolds as a series of stories told by an elderly King Graham to his granddaughter Gwendolyn, who listens from his bedside in the kingdom of Daventry[^ref-3]. When Graham dies in the game, he often rewinds the story a bit or remarks it was not what he did[^ref-3]. His narration is also heard during regular gameplay, especially for descriptions of the environment[^ref-3].

The game offers entirely new stories and characters, but they often reference the earlier games[^ref-3]. The new stories are not told in chronological order and are interspersed with sections in the present that revolve around Gwendolyn[^ref-3]. The protagonist is Graham, the same protagonist who first appeared in the original King's Quest in 1984[^ref-3].

The game consists of five chapters[^ref-3]:
- **Chapter 1: A Knight to Remember** - A young Graham arrives in Daventry and enters a grand tournament to become a Knight of Daventry
- **Chapter 2: Rubble Without a Cause** - Graham must rescue his kidnapped friends from goblins
- **Chapter 3: Once Upon a Climb** - Graham is trapped in a tower with two princesses and must choose between them for his future wife, reimagining King's Quest II
- **Chapter 4: Snow Place Like Home** - Graham deals with challenges as an aging king
- **Chapter 5: The Good Knight** - The concluding chapter explores themes of mortality, legacy, and what we leave behind

The Complete Collection includes an exclusive epilogue that shifts perspective to Gwendolyn, who applies the lessons learned from her grandfather's stories during her first independent adventure[^ref-4].

## Gameplay

The game environment is shown through different perspectives for each scene with scrolling parts, but the camera cannot be controlled[^ref-3]. Visually it has a cel-shaded graphical style[^ref-3]. The player can move Graham freely in the 3D environment[^ref-3].

### Interface and Controls
- When Graham is close to an interesting element, this is signified through one or multiple icons in the bottom right corner of the screen[^ref-3]
- The player can choose to examine, interact, or pick up objects[^ref-3]
- Collected items are stored in an inventory[^ref-3]
- In many locations it is possible to switch to a first-person perspective to examine the environment[^ref-3]

### Structure and Progression
- The game largely focuses on the story and puzzle-solving, but there is also a large amount of exploration and action sequences with escapes and fighting[^ref-3]
- Graham often needs to run and he can also push or manipulate objects in various ways[^ref-3]
- These sections are sometimes shown from a first-person perspective[^ref-3]
- There are many cut-scenes, on-rails sequences, and some Quick Time Events[^ref-3]

### Puzzles and Mechanics
- The game incorporates choices and consequences in various ways and they are carried across episodes[^ref-3]
- There are many branching dialogue options that lead to different outcomes[^ref-3]
- Puzzles often have multiple approaches without a fixed solution[^ref-3]
- Generally there are three types of choices to make or paths to follow: bravery, wisdom, or compassion, though these are never mentioned explicitly[^ref-3]
- This affects the story and especially the way Gwendolyn will act in the present as her grandfather's stories are the inspiration for her acts[^ref-3]
- These choice elements hearken back to the original King's Quest games, such as the multiple ways Graham could deal with the dragon in the first game[^ref-3]

## Development

### Origins
The 2015 King's Quest reboot originated in August 2014 when Activision announced the revival of the Sierra Entertainment label and selected independent studio The Odd Gentlemen to develop a new entry in the classic adventure series[^ref-1][^ref-4]. The game received a world premiere at The Game Awards 2014 on December 5, 2014, generating significant buzz for the franchise revival[^ref-14]. Creative Director Matt Korba led the project, envisioning a reimagining of King Graham's story structured around an elderly Graham recounting his adventures to granddaughter Gwendolyn[^ref-4].

### Production
The game was developed as a five-part episodic adventure series, serving as both a reboot and re-imagining of the classic King's Quest franchise[^ref-3]. The development team chose to include the framing device of the grandfather-granddaughter storytelling to provide greater emotional depth and explore themes of legacy, heroism, and mortality[^ref-3]. The script for the first chapter alone was 640 pages long, including branching paths, Easter eggs, narration, object use and interaction, and dialogue trees[^ref-16]. Each chapter of the series was longer and more complex than similar episodic series such as those made by Telltale Games[^ref-16].

According to Creative Director Matt Korba, the game's controls focused on "one-button context," resulting in a game without complicated interfaces or controls[^ref-16]. The original games are considered part of the canon of the new series, with each chapter taking place between those games; however, previous games may be reinterpreted in completely new ways[^ref-16]. Korba emphasized that all the choices made by Graham are heroic, and there is no way for players to build a "bad" Graham[^ref-16].

The voice cast features veteran actor Christopher Lloyd (Doc Brown from Back to the Future) as the elderly King Graham, with Josh Keaton (Shiro from Voltron) voicing young Graham[^ref-9][^ref-11][^ref-16]. Wallace Shawn (Rex from Toy Story, Vizzini from The Princess Bride) voices the antagonist Manannan, bringing what reviewers described as "a quick-witted but twisted feel"[^ref-11]. Maggie Elizabeth Jones delivers a standout performance as Gwendolyn, with her "enthusiasm and childlike innocence" praised by critics[^ref-11]. Additional voice talent includes Tom Kenny (SpongeBob SquarePants), Loretta Devine, Kevin Michael Richardson, and Zelda Williams (daughter of Robin Williams)[^ref-12][^ref-15][^ref-16].

### Technical Achievements
- Built on Unreal Engine 3 supporting hand-drawn art integration with cel-shaded graphical style[^ref-2][^ref-3]
- Multi-platform release across Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One[^ref-3]
- Choice-consequence mechanics tracking player decisions across virtue categories (bravery, wisdom, compassion)[^ref-3]
- Branching dialogue system affecting narrative outcomes across all five episodes[^ref-3]
- First-person perspective mode for detailed environmental examination[^ref-3]
- Quick Time Events integrated into action sequences[^ref-3]
- Released: July 28, 2015 (Chapter 1), with subsequent chapters through October 2016[^ref-4]

## Legacy

King's Quest (2015) played a crucial role in reviving interest in the dormant franchise, which had seen no major entries since 1998's King's Quest: Mask of Eternity[^ref-1]. The reboot demonstrated the enduring appeal of whimsical adventure gaming and fairy-tale storytelling, drawing both longtime fans and newcomers to explore the series' rich heritage.

The game's innovative narrative structure, blending traditional adventure game mechanics with choice-driven storytelling through the grandfather-granddaughter framing device, influenced modern episodic adventure design[^ref-3]. Creative Director Matt Korba confirmed that King's Quest: Mask of Eternity is canon to the 2015 reboot, though Connor did not ultimately appear in the game[^ref-1].

The series remains available through digital distribution on Steam[^ref-5].

## See Also

The 2015 King's Quest game serves as a reimagining of the classic franchise, featuring an elderly King Graham narrating his youthful adventures to his granddaughter Gwendolyn. This approach diverges from the direct narrative continuation seen in previous games like King's Quest - Mask of Eternity, instead opting for a flashback structure that explores Graham's past exploits in a non-linear fashion. By doing so, the game creates a sense of nostalgia and depth, drawing upon the rich history of the series while introducing new characters and storylines.

In terms of gameplay mechanics, the 2015 King's Quest builds upon the foundations established in earlier games, incorporating elements such as puzzle-solving, exploration, and branching dialogue options. The game's use of a cel-shaded graphical style and scrolling environments also marks a significant departure from the more traditional graphics seen in Mask of Eternity, reflecting the evolution of the series over time. As the game progresses, Graham's adventures become increasingly intertwined with the present-day narrative, ultimately culminating in an exclusive epilogue that shifts perspective to Gwendolyn and explores themes of legacy and mortality.

The connections between the 2015 King's Quest and its predecessors are further reinforced by the game's numerous references to earlier entries in the series. For example, Chapter 3: Once Upon a Climb reimagines key elements from King's Quest II, while the game's overall narrative structure and character development draw inspiration from various other titles in the franchise. As such, the 2015 King's Quest can be seen as both a nostalgic tribute to the series' roots and a bold step forward into new territory, laying the groundwork for potential future entries in the King's Quest saga.
