# King's Quest II: Romancing the Throne

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

King's Quest II: Romancing the Throne is the second installment in the King's Quest series, released in May 1985 for IBM PC and PCjr[^ref-1][^ref-2]. Designed by [[Roberta Williams]], it uses the AGI (Adventure Game Interpreter) engine developed for the original King's Quest[^ref-1][^ref-3]. The subtitle parodies the 1984 Robert Zemeckis film Romancing the Stone[^ref-4][^ref-5]. Computer Gaming World praised it as having "the best graphics on a home computer"[^ref-6], while Compute! magazine described it as "like playing an animated cartoon"[^ref-7].

## Story Summary

One year after recovering the three stolen treasures and becoming King of Daventry, Graham seeks a wife[^ref-8]. Looking into the magic mirror, he sees a beautiful woman named Valanice imprisoned atop a quartz tower in the distant land of Kolyma by the witch Hagatha[^ref-1][^ref-9][^ref-10]. Graham travels to Kolyma to rescue her, where he must find three golden keys to unlock three magical doors leading to the enchanted island where Valanice is held[^ref-8][^ref-10].

The land of Kolyma draws from folklore, mythology, and classic literature[^ref-4]. Graham encounters King Neptune in an underwater kingdom, Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother, and Count Dracula in a haunted castle[^ref-1][^ref-4]. A genie's lamp grants three predetermined wishes: a bridle, a sword, and a magic carpet[^ref-4]. After overcoming these challenges, Graham rescues Valanice and they marry[^ref-9].

## Gameplay

King's Quest II shares the same engine and visual style as its predecessor[^ref-4]. Like Daventry in the first game, Kolyma is a cyclical world where traveling north or south wraps around[^ref-1]. However, unlike King's Quest I where tasks could be completed in any order, this sequel requires finding each key in sequence, creating more linear progression[^ref-4][^ref-10].

### Interface and Controls

Players move Graham using keyboard arrow keys and perform actions by typing verb-noun commands such as "open door" or "take lamp"[^ref-1][^ref-10]. One innovation introduced in King's Quest II is adjustable walking speed—typing "slow," "normal," or "fast" changes Graham's movement speed[^ref-11]. The DOS conversion added a "fastest" option[^ref-11].

### Structure and Progression

The game features goal-sensitive events where the world changes as the story progresses[^ref-10]. The antique shop remains closed until a specific action is performed, and characters appear only when the story is ready[^ref-10]. This evolution from King's Quest I's open-ended treasure hunt established "the more linear, story-driven model still widely used in adventure games today"[^ref-10].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

- Puzzles typically involve trading items or using them to bypass obstacles[^ref-1]
- Knowledge of fairy tales helps solve certain puzzles[^ref-1]
- Complex solutions earn more points than brute force approaches[^ref-1]
- **Maximum score: 185 points**[^ref-12]
- Some points are mutually exclusive—for example, killing the snake earns 2 points, but using the bridle on the snake earns 2 points plus allows obtaining a sugar cube worth 1 additional point[^ref-12]

### The Bridge Trap

The game's most notorious design element is a rickety bridge leading to the magical doors. The bridge can only be crossed approximately seven times—just enough to complete the game optimally[^ref-4][^ref-13]. There is no warning that the bridge will collapse[^ref-4][^ref-10]. Hardcore Gaming 101 called this "the most remarkably cruel aspect of King's Quest II," noting "it never clues you in, but you can only cross this bridge a very, very limited amount of times"[^ref-4]. Adventure Gamers described it as "a cruel setup that more or less ensures that new players will have to start over near the beginning at some point"[^ref-10]. The bridge trap was later referenced in Sierra's Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist[^ref-4].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

King's Quest II received enthusiastic reviews upon release. Aktueller Software Markt (ASM) awarded the Atari ST version 98% (39/40)[^ref-1]. Consumer Software News proclaimed, "If you liked King's Quest you'll love the sequel"[^ref-7]. Computer Entertainment declared "Roberta Williams has simply outdone herself"[^ref-7]. QuestBusters Journal praised "the most lushly painted and highly detailed scenery seen since...well King's Quest I"[^ref-7].

**Contemporary Scores:**
- **Tilt (Apple II):** 100%[^ref-1]
- **Techtite (Apple II):** 100%[^ref-1]
- **ASM (Atari ST):** 98%[^ref-1]
- **CU Amiga:** 84%[^ref-1]
- **ST Magazine:** 80%[^ref-1]
- **Computer + Video Games:** 6/10[^ref-14]
- **Critics Average:** 77%[^ref-1]

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospectives acknowledge the game's historical importance while noting dated mechanics. Adventure Gamers rated it 3/5 ("Decent"), praising its nostalgic appeal but criticizing the bridge trap[^ref-10]. Hardcore Gaming 101 assessed it as "more of the same" that "does little to improve the formula, but doesn't really screw it up much either"[^ref-4]. The Adventure Gamer blog scored it 53 points on the PISSED rating scale[^ref-6].

**Modern Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** 7.1/10 MobyScore, 77% critics (13 ratings), 3.5/5 players (105 ratings)[^ref-1]
- **GOG:** 4.1/5 (41 reviews, KQ 1+2+3 bundle)[^ref-26]
- **Steam:** 86% Very Positive (306 reviews, KQ Collection)[^ref-27]
- **IMDB:** 7.1/10 (142 votes)[^ref-15]
- **Adventure Gamers:** 3/5[^ref-10]
- **HowLongToBeat:** 61% user rating, ~3 hours average completion, 37 minutes fastest[^ref-16]
- **Choicest Games:** 4/10 ("simply too damn difficult")[^ref-17]

## Development

### Origins

Development of King's Quest II served as a training ground for Sierra employees new to the AGI technology[^ref-3]. [[Scott Murphy]] and [[Mark Crowe]], who would later create the Space Quest series, joined the team along with [[Al Lowe]], future creator of Leisure Suit Larry[^ref-3][^ref-17]. As DOS Days documented: "These people included Scott Murphy, Mark Crowe and Al Lowe, who would later become famous adventure game creators themselves"[^ref-3].

Roberta Williams explained that ideas cut from the original game found their home in the sequel: "I couldn't fit some ideas into King's Quest I, so I was happy to get a chance to include King Neptune, Dracula, everyone from Little Red Riding Hood, and that infamous rickety old bridge you could only cross so many times"[^ref-18].

### Production

**Development Credits:**[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- **Design/Writing:** [[Roberta Williams]]
- **Story:** Annette Childs (manual backstory), Roberta Williams[^ref-15]
- **Programming:** Ken Williams, Sol Ackerman, Chris Iden, Jeff Stephenson, Scott Murphy[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- **Animation:** Mark Crowe[^ref-1]
- **Scenery:** Doug MacNeill[^ref-1]
- **Music:** Al Lowe[^ref-1][^ref-3]

The manual contains a prologue written by Annette Childs about King Edward's spirit advising Graham to find a wife[^ref-15]. Al Lowe also wrote the official hint book[^ref-19].

### Technical Specifications

- **CPU:** 8088 or 8086 compatible[^ref-3][^ref-7]
- **RAM:** 256KB (DOS version); 128KB (booter version)[^ref-3][^ref-11]
- **DOS:** Version 2.11 or later[^ref-3]
- **Graphics:** Hercules, CGA, EGA, VGA, Tandy supported[^ref-3]
- **Resolution:** 320×200 pixels in up to 16 colors (EGA mode)[^ref-3]
- **Audio:** PC speaker or Tandy 3-voice sound[^ref-3]
- **Installed Size:** 588 KB[^ref-3]

The booter version plays music at a slower tempo and louder volume compared to the DOS conversion[^ref-11].

### Technical Innovations

- **First opening cutscene:** First King's Quest title to feature an opening cutscene following the credits sequence[^ref-32]
- **Goal-sensitive events:** The game world dynamically changes as players advance—new characters appear, areas open and close based on story progression[^ref-10][^ref-32]
- **Linear story structure:** Introduced the "more linear, story-driven model still widely used in adventure games today"[^ref-10]

### Music and Audio

Al Lowe composed fourteen musical selections for the soundtrack, incorporating Tchaikovsky's "Romeo and Juliet" theme[^ref-1][^ref-3][^ref-17][^ref-32]. DOS Days noted that "KQ2 has over twice the number of songs as KQ1" while reusing some tracks including the Title, Danger, and Dead themes[^ref-3]. The opening screen features "Greensleeves" on the PC speaker[^ref-10]. The music outside Dracula's castle samples Michael Jackson's "Thriller"[^ref-15][^ref-20].

### Version History

| Version | Date | Platform | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| 1.0W | 1985 | DOS (Booter) | PC Booter version[^ref-3] |
| 1.0H | 1985 | DOS (Booter) | PC Booter, Hercules support[^ref-3] |
| 2.1 | April 10, 1987 | DOS | Key disk protection, EGA support[^ref-3] |
| 2.2 | May 7, 1987 | DOS | Key disk protection[^ref-3] |
| 2.2 | December 1, 1987 | DOS | AGIMIDI support added[^ref-3] |
| Mac | 1987 | Macintosh | Mac port with 4givmeken backdoor[^ref-22] |

**AGI Interpreter Versions:**[^ref-3]

| Game Version | Interpreter | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| 1.0W | AGI v1 | PC Booter |
| 1.0H | AGI v1 | PC Booter |
| 2.1 | AGI2 v2.411 | DOS disk version |
| 2.2 (April) | AGI2 v2.426 | DOS disk version |
| 2.2 (December) | AGI2 v2.917 | AGIMIDI support |

**Copy Protection:** Early versions used self-booting "PC Booter" disks. Later versions employed SuperLok 3.2 "key disk" protection using track 0 checksum errors or non-standard sector sizes[^ref-3]. The Mac version includes a backdoor: when prompted for the master disk, holding Command and typing "4givmeken" (asking forgiveness from Ken Williams) bypasses the check[^ref-22].

## Legacy

King's Quest II continued Sierra's dominance in the adventure game market. The game served as a training ground for future Sierra legends—Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe (Space Quest) and Al Lowe (Leisure Suit Larry) all worked on the project[^ref-3][^ref-17].

### Remakes

**Cancelled Sierra VGA Remake:** Sierra planned to remake King's Quest II in VGA following the 1990 King's Quest I remake. However, due to disappointing sales of that remake and the "colorization controversy," the official King's Quest II remake was cancelled[^ref-19].

**AGD Interactive VGA Remake (2002):** AGD Interactive (formerly Tierra Entertainment) released "King's Quest II: Romancing the Stones," an unofficial VGA remake that accumulated over 451,400 downloads[^ref-23]. Features include point-and-click interface, full voice acting with Josh Mandel reprising King Graham, Adventure Game Studio engine, substantially rewritten plot with new characters, and the infamous bridge no longer collapsing[^ref-4][^ref-23][^ref-24]. Hardcore Gaming 101 declared the remake "far exceeds any of the work Sierra themselves put into any of their VGA remakes"[^ref-4]. The soundtrack features nearly two hours of original music by Tom Lewandowski[^ref-33].

**2015 Reboot:** The third chapter of the 2015 King's Quest reboot, titled "Once Upon a Climb" (April 2016), reimagines the rescue of Valanice[^ref-25].

### The King's Quest Companion

*The King's Quest Companion* by Peter Spear presents King's Quest II through the fictional narrator Derek Karlavaegen, a chronicler from Daventry who communicates with our world through the "Eye Between the Worlds"—a strange metal head with a glass eye and keyboard-like teeth found in a secret laboratory[^ref-12]. The Companion documents the complete 185-point breakdown by area[^ref-12]. Roberta Williams endorsed the book, calling it "an interesting blend of fiction and helpful information" that is "invaluable" for anyone wanting to understand the story behind King's Quest[^ref-34].

### Easter Eggs and Unused Content

**Easter Eggs:**
- **Batmobile:** The 1960s Batmobile occasionally drives out of Hagatha's cave, accompanied by a version of the Batman theme. The narrator quips: "He must have gotten lost. I do not think he belongs in this story."[^ref-1][^ref-15][^ref-20][^ref-21][^ref-35]
- **Space Quest Demo:** Looking in a hole in the cliff area plays a promotional demo for Space Quest, whose designers (Murphy and Crowe) worked on this game[^ref-1][^ref-8]
- **Hidden Sign:** A sign advertising Space Quest I and King's Quest III appears in later versions[^ref-8]
- **Personal Death Message:** When the player dies, a personal message from Roberta and Ken Williams displays[^ref-10]

**Trivia:**
- **Kolyma's Name:** The land of Kolyma is named after a river in northeastern Siberia, notorious for Soviet gulag prison camps—though this dark connection was likely unintentional[^ref-1]
- **Thriller Sample:** The music outside Dracula's castle samples Michael Jackson's "Thriller"[^ref-15][^ref-20]
- **Mac Backdoor:** When prompted for the master disk on Mac, holding Command and typing "4givmeken" (asking forgiveness from Ken Williams) bypasses copy protection[^ref-22]

**Unused Content (The Cutting Room Floor):**[^ref-22]
- An alternate, larger genie graphic—the final game uses a smaller genie attached to Graham's sprite
- Three different gold key designs, suggesting each door may have originally required a distinct key
- A "Dead Fish" item (Object ID 84) with the description: "The lovely fish is dead. The golden scales are already dulling"
- Unused text including a rejected risqué description of Valanice
- Debug commands activated by pressing ALT+D or typing "FAST TALK"
- Unused sounds: happy melody, digging, tide/waves, striking effects, and an early slower Batman theme
