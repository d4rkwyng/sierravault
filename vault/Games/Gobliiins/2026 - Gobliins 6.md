 Gobliins 6: The Madmen of the Year 1000

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 11, 2026</small>

## Overview

*Gobliins 6: The Madmen of the Year 1000* is a 2026 2D puzzle adventure game that serves as a direct sequel to *[[1992 - Gobliins 2 - The Prince Buffoon\|Gobliins 2: The Prince Buffoon]]*, reuniting the beloved duo Fingus and Winkle more than thirty years after their original adventure.[^ref-1][^ref-2] Developed by [[Pierre Gilhodes]] and published through his independent [[Schnibble Productions]] label, the game represents a continuation of Gilhodes' personal stewardship of the franchise he co-created at Coktel Vision in 1991.[^ref-1][^ref-6]

The game was successfully crowdfunded on Kickstarter from October 10 to November 9, 2024, raising €9,524 from 388 backers against a modest €4,000 goal—exceeding its target by more than double.[^ref-1][^ref-3] Built using Adventure Game Studio (AGS), the same engine that powered *Gobliiins 5*, the game promises to deliver classic point-and-click gameplay with modern quality-of-life improvements while maintaining the series' distinctive humor and charm.[^ref-3][^ref-5]

Following the traditional series naming convention established in 1991, the two "i"s in "Gobliins" indicate the number of playable goblin characters, distinguishing it from the original *Gobliiins* (three goblins), *Goblins 3* (one goblin), and *Gobliiins 5* (three goblins).[^ref-2][^ref-4] This return to the two-goblin format was a deliberate creative choice to revisit the gameplay dynamic that made *Gobliins 2* particularly popular among fans.[^ref-1][^ref-2]

## Story Summary

The narrative of *Gobliins 6* takes place years after the events of *Gobliins 2*, during which Fingus and Winkle successfully rescued Prince Buffoon from the clutches of the evil Doer.[^ref-1][^ref-2] In the intervening decades, the two goblins have drifted apart, each pursuing their own quiet lives in the kingdom.

### Fingus's Solitary Life

**Fingus**, the more cautious and methodical of the duo, has become a lonely and somewhat melancholic beekeeper.[^ref-1][^ref-2] His quiet, simple existence among the hives reflects his contemplative nature, though there are hints that he misses the excitement of his adventuring days. The years have not been entirely kind to Fingus—his isolation suggests a goblin who has retreated from the world, perhaps troubled by memories of past adventures or simply worn down by the passage of time.[^ref-1][^ref-7]

### The Mysterious Disappearance

Fingus's peaceful existence is shattered when he receives troubling news: his old friend **Winkle** has gone missing under mysterious and concerning circumstances.[^ref-1][^ref-3] The nature of Winkle's disappearance is shrouded in mystery, compelling Fingus to abandon his beekeeping and embark on a journey to find his former companion.[^ref-1][^ref-2]

### The Threat of Karcassio

Once the two goblins are reunited, they discover a far greater threat than they anticipated. A cruel conqueror named **Karcassio** threatens the kingdom with tyranny and destruction.[^ref-1][^ref-2] The reunited duo must work together to thwart Karcassio's sinister plans and save both their friend and the realm. Their journey will be filled with "humor, mystery, and unexpected twists" as they face challenges that test both their individual abilities and their partnership.[^ref-2][^ref-7]

According to the Adventure Gamers coverage, players will also encounter "multiple objectives driving the plot, including their quest to find the son of King Angoulafre, the Prince Buffoon," suggesting connections to the events and characters of the original *Gobliins 2*.[^ref-12]

## Gameplay

*Gobliins 6* returns to the two-goblin cooperative puzzle format that distinguished *Gobliins 2* from other entries in the series, offering point-and-click adventure gameplay built in Adventure Game Studio.[^ref-1][^ref-3] The game is designed to capture the spirit of classic adventure gaming while incorporating modern conveniences and expanded content.

### The Two Goblins

The core gameplay revolves around controlling two distinct goblins, each with their own personality and approach to problem-solving:[^ref-2][^ref-4]

**Fingus** – The cautious, methodical goblin who approaches situations with care and logical thinking. When interacting with objects and characters, Fingus tends to find sensible, practical solutions. His careful nature makes him ideal for delicate operations and situations requiring patience.[^ref-2][^ref-4]

**Winkle** – The impulsive, mischievous goblin whose chaotic actions can both hinder progress and reveal unexpected solutions. Winkle's unpredictable nature means his interactions often produce surprising (and frequently hilarious) results. While his methods may seem counterproductive, they sometimes unlock solutions that more conventional approaches would miss.[^ref-2][^ref-4]

The interplay between these contrasting personalities forms the foundation of the puzzle design, requiring players to understand when each goblin's unique approach is needed.[^ref-2][^ref-4]

### Puzzle Design Philosophy

The game features level-based puzzle design requiring careful coordination between both goblins.[^ref-2][^ref-4] Players must switch between Fingus and Winkle, using their different abilities and behavioral patterns to solve environmental puzzles and progress through the story. Many puzzles will require sequential or simultaneous actions from both characters, creating a satisfying cooperative dynamic even in single-player mode.[^ref-1][^ref-3]

Unlike the original *Gobliiins* from 1991, *Gobliins 6* does not feature a life meter or health system.[^ref-4][^ref-8] Failed interactions do not result in penalties or game over states—instead, unsuccessful attempts trigger comedic animations that showcase the goblins' personalities and provide entertainment value even in failure.[^ref-4][^ref-8] This design choice removes frustration while maintaining the exploratory spirit that defined the series.

### Improvements Over Gobliiins 5

The development team has outlined several improvements and enhancements compared to *Gobliiins 5*:[^ref-1][^ref-3]

**Visual Presentation:**
- 16:9 widescreen format for modern monitors, expanding the viewable play area[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- 640×480 resolution with 2D graphics featuring rich, detailed animations[^ref-3]
- Enhanced visual polish while maintaining the classic art style

**Content Expansion:**
- More puzzles than previous entries[^ref-1][^ref-2]
- Greater variety of characters to encounter and interact with[^ref-1][^ref-2]
- Additional comedic situations and humorous scenarios[^ref-1][^ref-2]

**Technical Conveniences:**
- Single executable file with in-game language selection, eliminating the need for separate language versions[^ref-3][^ref-5]
- Enhanced save system featuring automatic saving at each level plus manual saves available at any time[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- Streamlined interface for modern players while retaining classic point-and-click mechanics

### Control System

The game utilizes the traditional Adventure Game Studio point-and-click interface, allowing players to interact with the environment using mouse controls.[^ref-3][^ref-5] Players can click on objects, characters, and environmental elements to trigger interactions, with each goblin producing different results based on their personality.[^ref-2][^ref-4]

## Development

### Kickstarter Campaign

The Kickstarter campaign for *Gobliins 6* launched on October 10, 2024, and ran until November 9, 2024.[^ref-1][^ref-3] Pierre Gilhodes set a modest funding goal of €4,000, a conservative target that reflected both the independent nature of the project and Gilhodes' experience with crowdfunding from the *Gobliiins 5* campaign.[^ref-1][^ref-9]

The campaign ultimately raised €9,524 from 388 backers, exceeding its goal by 238%.[^ref-1][^ref-3] This strong performance demonstrated continued community interest in the Gobliiins franchise and support for Gilhodes' vision of continuing the series independently. The campaign's success was notable given the niche nature of classic point-and-click adventure games in the modern gaming landscape.[^ref-3][^ref-9]

### Funding Allocation

According to the Kickstarter campaign details, the raised funds are being allocated across several key development areas:[^ref-1]

**Music Production:**
- Composition and production by Butterfly Tea, continuing the partnership established in *Gobliiins 5*[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- Original score designed to match the whimsical tone of the series

**Art and Animation:**
- Graphic design work for characters, environments, and objects[^ref-1]
- Animation production for the detailed character movements the series is known for[^ref-1]

**Quality Assurance:**
- Testing to ensure puzzle logic works correctly[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- Bug fixing and polish across all game systems[^ref-3]
- Localization quality verification for multiple languages

### Development Progress

At the conclusion of the Kickstarter campaign in November 2024, Pierre Gilhodes reported that approximately 75% of the game was already complete.[^ref-1][^ref-9] The remaining work was estimated to require approximately 2.5 years of additional development time, suggesting a potential release in late 2026 or 2027.[^ref-1][^ref-9]

### Status Update (December 2025)

In a Facebook post on December 15, 2025, Pierre Gilhodes provided an encouraging update on the project's status: "The game is almost finished, but still a thousand things to do, including finishing the translation and integrating it, a big piece. Thank you for your patience."[^ref-11] This update indicates substantial progress beyond the 75% completion reported at the end of the Kickstarter campaign, with translation and localization emerging as the primary remaining work.[^ref-11]

The update suggests the game has moved from active content development into the finalization and polish phase, a positive sign for backers and fans awaiting the release.[^ref-11]

### Status Update (February 2026) — Imminent Release

In a Kickstarter update posted on February 2, 2026, Pierre Gilhodes announced that the game's release is imminent.[^ref-13] The update stated: "As soon as the game is released, and as soon as I have collected the keys, I start sending you the emails. I send a Steam key by default, but let me know quickly if you prefer an Itch.io key, or the game files."[^ref-13]

This announcement confirms that *Gobliins 6* has completed development and is awaiting final release logistics. Backers will receive their keys via email, with Steam as the default distribution platform and Itch.io available as an alternative.[^ref-13]

### Release (February 10-13, 2026)

*Gobliins 6: The Madmen of the Year 1000* was released on itch.io on February 10, 2026, with the Steam release following on February 13, 2026.[^ref-14][^ref-15] In a Kickstarter update announcing the release, Pierre Gilhodes wrote: "Hello, all mailings are done, check your spam emails. Let me know in case of any problem. The game should be on Steam on Friday. See you soon."[^ref-15]

### Technical Foundation

*Gobliins 6* is being developed using Adventure Game Studio (AGS), a free game development tool specifically designed for creating point-and-click adventure games.[^ref-3][^ref-5] This same engine powered *Gobliiins 5* (2023), allowing Gilhodes to leverage his experience and potentially reuse certain technical frameworks while creating new content.[^ref-3]

The choice of AGS reflects Gilhodes' commitment to an "oldschool-style" approach to development, prioritizing classic 2D adventure game aesthetics and mechanics over modern 3D graphics.[^ref-3] The engine's flexibility has allowed for the implementation of custom features like the enhanced save system and multi-language support.[^ref-3][^ref-5]

## Reception

### Kickstarter Reception

The crowdfunding campaign generated significant positive response within the adventure gaming community, with the campaign exceeding its goal by more than 100%.[^ref-1][^ref-3] Backers expressed enthusiasm for several key aspects of the project:

**Return to Two-Goblin Format:**
Fans praised the decision to return to the *Gobliins 2* duo rather than continuing the three-goblin format of *Gobliiins 5*. The two-character dynamic was widely considered the high point of the original series, offering more focused puzzle design and stronger character development.[^ref-1][^ref-2][^ref-9]

**Direct Sequel Approach:**
The choice to create a direct sequel to *Gobliins 2*, continuing the story of Fingus and Winkle, resonated with long-time fans who had followed these characters since 1992.[^ref-2][^ref-4] The thirty-year gap between games added nostalgic appeal while promising a fresh adventure.[^ref-2][^ref-9]

**Creator Continuity:**
Pierre Gilhodes' continued involvement as the driving creative force behind the series provided assurance of authentic continuation of the franchise's spirit and humor.[^ref-1][^ref-6][^ref-9]

### Community Discussion

The announcement of *Gobliins 6* sparked active discussions across adventure gaming communities:[^ref-3][^ref-7][^ref-8]

**Adventure Gamers Forum:**
The Adventure Gamers forum hosted extensive discussion about the project, with community members sharing memories of the original games and expressing support for the continuation of the series.[^ref-3] Users noted appreciation for Gilhodes' dedication to the franchise over three decades.[^ref-3]

**GOG.com Forums:**
The GOG community discussed the Kickstarter campaign, with users expressing hope that the completed game would eventually be released on the GOG platform alongside the existing Gobliiins collection.[^ref-7]

**RPG Codex:**
Discussion on RPG Codex included detailed analysis of the gameplay improvements promised in the campaign, with community members debating the merits of the two-goblin versus three-goblin format.[^ref-9]

**Steam Gifts:**
The Steam Gifts community highlighted the project's Kickstarter campaign, with users sharing their backing experiences and discussing expectations for the final product.[^ref-8]

### Critical Context

As an unreleased title, *Gobliins 6* has not yet received formal critical reviews. However, the positive reception of *Gobliiins 5* (2023) and the strong Kickstarter performance suggest a receptive audience awaits the game's eventual release.[^ref-2][^ref-3]

## Legacy

### Continuation of a Classic Franchise

*Gobliins 6* represents a remarkable continuation of a franchise that began at Coktel Vision in 1991.[^ref-4][^ref-6] The original *Gobliiins* was notable for its innovative multi-character puzzle design, requiring players to coordinate three goblins with different abilities to solve challenges. This formula evolved through subsequent entries, with each game varying the number of playable characters.[^ref-4]

### Series Timeline

The Gobliiins series spans over three decades:[^ref-4][^ref-6]

| Year | Title | Goblins | Publisher |
|------|-------|---------|-----------|
| 1991 | Gobliiins | 3 | Coktel Vision |
| 1992 | Gobliins 2: The Prince Buffoon | 2 | Coktel Vision |
| 1993 | Goblins Quest 3 | 1 | Coktel Vision |
| 2023 | Gobliiins 5: The Morgloton Invasion | 3 | Schnibble Productions |
| 2026 | Gobliins 6: The Madmen of the Year 1000 | 2 | Schnibble Productions |

### Pierre Gilhodes' Vision

Pierre Gilhodes has maintained creative control of the Gobliiins franchise for its entire existence, a rare achievement in the video game industry.[^ref-1][^ref-6] His work at Coktel Vision established the series' distinctive combination of puzzle gameplay, absurdist humor, and charming character design. The continuation through *Gobliiins 5* and now *Gobliins 6* under his independent Schnibble Productions label demonstrates his commitment to the franchise beyond commercial considerations.[^ref-1][^ref-6]

According to MobyGames, Gilhodes' career in game development spans decades, with the Gobliiins series representing his most significant and enduring contribution to the medium.[^ref-6]

### Revival of Classic Adventure Gaming

*Gobliins 6* joins a broader movement of classic adventure game revivals in the 2020s, though it stands apart by featuring the original creator rather than a studio attempting to revive an acquired IP.[^ref-1][^ref-3] The crowdfunding approach allows Gilhodes to develop the game according to his artistic vision without publisher interference, ensuring authentic continuation of the series' spirit.[^ref-1][^ref-9]

### The "ii" Convention

The Gobliiins naming convention, where the number of "i"s indicates playable goblins, has become iconic in adventure gaming circles.[^ref-4][^ref-10] This creative approach to sequels—changing both the title and core gameplay structure—was innovative for its time and remains distinctive. *Gobliins 6* continues this tradition, with its two "i"s signaling the return to the beloved duo format.[^ref-2][^ref-4][^ref-10]
