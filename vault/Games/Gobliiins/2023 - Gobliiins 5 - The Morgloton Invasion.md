# Gobliiins 5: The Morgloton Invasion

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 30, 2026</small>

## Overview

Gobliiins 5: The Morgloton Invasion (stylized as GOBLiiiNS 5) is a 2D point-and-click adventure game released in 2023, marking the long-awaited return of the beloved Gobliiins franchise after more than a decade[^ref-1]. Developed independently by [[Pierre Gilhodes]], the original creator of the series at Coktel Vision, the game was successfully crowdfunded through campaigns on Ulule and Kickstarter, raising over €10,000 to support its production[^ref-2]. The game features the return of the original three goblins from the first 1991 installment—Oups, Asgard, and Ignatius—reuniting them for a new adventure thirty years after the series began[^ref-1].

Following the naming convention established by the series, the three 'i's in "Gobliiins" indicate that players control three goblin characters simultaneously, each possessing unique abilities essential for solving the game's cooperative puzzles[^ref-3]. The game was initially released on itch.io on May 2, 2023, followed by a Steam release on July 20, 2023[^ref-2]. Unlike the poorly received 3D-rendered Gobliiins 4 (2009), this fifth installment returns to the series' 2D roots, featuring hand-drawn animation that captures the charm and visual style of the classic titles[^ref-4].

The game represents a remarkable solo development effort, with Gilhodes handling design, artwork, and implementation using the Adventure Game Studio engine[^ref-5]. Despite not being a programmer by trade, Gilhodes managed to create a full-length adventure game that evokes strong nostalgia among fans of the original trilogy while introducing the series to new players[^ref-6]. As one player remarked, "I honestly can't believe I got to play a new Gobliiins game after 30 years - very very happy!"[^ref-7].

## Story Summary

The kingdom of King Angoulafre faces a dire threat when the mad scientist Morglott initiates a sinister plan to transform all of the king's subjects into anthropomorphic potatoes using a mysterious magic ray[^ref-1]. The bizarre transformation begins spreading across the land, turning innocent townsfolk into potato-people and throwing the kingdom into chaos. King Angoulafre, desperate to save his realm, summons the three heroic goblins who once saved the kingdom in ages past[^ref-8].

Oups, Asgard, and Ignatius—the original trio from the first Gobliiins game—answer the call and are sent on a quest to discover the source of the magic ray and put an end to Morglott's diabolical scheme[^ref-1]. Each goblin brings their unique talents to the mission: their different abilities must be coordinated carefully to overcome the obstacles that stand between them and the mad scientist's lair. The journey takes them through sixteen large levels filled with bizarre characters, outlandish situations, and the series' trademark absurdist humor[^ref-10].

Along the way, the goblins encounter various characters including Frippone and must navigate through increasingly complex environments to reach Morglott[^ref-7]. The narrative maintains the light-hearted, comedic tone that defined the original trilogy, with the plot serving primarily as a framework for the game's puzzle-focused gameplay rather than delivering deep narrative complexity[^ref-11]. The story culminates in a confrontation with Morglott, where the goblins must use all their combined skills to defeat him and reverse the potato transformation afflicting the kingdom's citizens[^ref-14].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Gobliiins 5 employs a classic point-and-click interface where players manipulate all three goblins simultaneously, sending them to various hotspots across single-screen puzzle environments[^ref-13]. The game features a 2D scrolling visual presentation with a third-person perspective, utilizing a point-and-select interface system characteristic of traditional adventure games[^ref-8]. Players click on objects and characters in the environment to interact with them, with each goblin responding differently based on their unique abilities[^ref-14].

The game supports both keyboard and mouse input, with controller support also available[^ref-9]. Players can switch between windowed and fullscreen display modes, and the game offers widescreen resolution support including multi-monitor, ultra-widescreen, and 4K Ultra HD compatibility[^ref-9]. The interface maintains the accessibility of the original games while taking advantage of modern display capabilities.

### Structure and Progression

The game is divided into four distinct parts, each containing four levels, for a total of sixteen substantial puzzle stages[^ref-2]. Each level presents a self-contained puzzle environment that must be solved before progressing, similar to the room-based structure of the original Gobliiins[^ref-15]. The game includes four separate executable files corresponding to each major section[^ref-2].

- **Part 1:** Introduction and initial puzzles (available as free demo)[^ref-16]
- **Part 2:** Continued investigation into the potato transformations
- **Part 3:** Described by players as the game's peak, featuring the most creative puzzles[^ref-16]
- **Part 4:** Final confrontation with Morglott

Individual levels typically require 30-60 minutes to complete, with the full game offering approximately 10 hours of gameplay—comparable in length to Gobliins 2[^ref-16]. Unlike some adventure games, Gobliiins 5 does not feature a traditional death mechanic, allowing players to experiment with puzzle solutions without fear of permanent failure[^ref-4].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

True to the series' heritage, Gobliiins 5 emphasizes wacky, unconventional puzzles that prioritize creativity and experimentation over strict logical deduction[^ref-4]. "Contrary to more conventional LucasArts-style adventure games, the Goblins series has always been more about wacky puzzles that don't necessarily make sense"[^ref-4]. Players must coordinate the actions of all three goblins to solve each screen's challenges, utilizing their distinct abilities in combination[^ref-14].

The puzzle design requires players to observe the environment carefully and experiment with different interaction sequences. Each goblin possesses unique capabilities that must be leveraged strategically—what one goblin cannot accomplish alone may become possible through teamwork[^ref-14]. The game features both inventory-based puzzles and environmental manipulation challenges, maintaining the series' tradition of combining item collection with character-specific actions[^ref-8].

The difficulty level has been described as accessible, with puzzles that are "logical and not too difficult" according to player feedback[^ref-17]. However, some players noted that certain items in the environment cannot be interacted with despite appearing otherwise, leading to occasional confusion[^ref-16].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Gobliiins 5 received a mixed but generally positive reception upon release, particularly from long-time fans of the series who appreciated its nostalgic appeal. Riot Pixels awarded the game a score of 65/100, describing it as "a strange game from a forgotten era. An experienced adventure lover will hardly regret a few evenings spent on it"[^ref-8]. The review acknowledged the game's appeal to nostalgic players while noting its limitations as a modern release.

Steam user reviews praised the game's faithfulness to the original trilogy. One reviewer stated: "What an amazing game. It has the exact feel like the first three Gobliiins. It's funny, the puzzles are logical and not too difficult and the story is nice"[^ref-17]. Another Steam user described it as feeling "unpolished on first glance but its a truly fun game and harks back to my childhood with GOBLIINS 3"[^ref-17]. The game earned a 4.9 out of 5 rating on itch.io, indicating strong approval from its direct audience[^ref-10].

### Modern Assessment

Critical assessment has positioned Gobliiins 5 as a worthy successor to the original trilogy, especially when compared to the divisive Gobliiins 4. Jefklak's Codex rated the game "Good," noting that "Gobliiins 5 is clearly a diamond in the rough, especially compared to the 3D failure of Gobliiins 4"[^ref-5]. The review acknowledged limitations stemming from the solo development approach but praised the overall achievement.

Community reception on GOG.com's wishlist page included enthusiastic endorsements: "This is a perfect match for GOG. It absolutely captures the feel and charm of the classic games and has amazingly detailed animation"[^ref-18]. RPG Codex forum users offered more nuanced assessments, with one describing it as "a picasso of adventure games. A labour of love from a true master"[^ref-16] while another noted it was "Pretty cool game, and while inferior to Gobs 2 and 3, it's little wonder given that this was only one guy working with an unfamiliar engine"[^ref-16].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** 65% (critic score)[^ref-8]
- **itch.io:** 4.9/5 (user ratings)[^ref-10]
- **Riot Pixels:** 65/100[^ref-8]

## Development

### Origins

The development of Gobliiins 5 began when Pierre Gilhodes, the original creator of the Gobliiins series at Coktel Vision, decided to revive the franchise independently[^ref-6]. Gilhodes had been the driving creative force behind the original games, also known for creating the cult classic Woodruff and the Schnibble of Azimuth[^ref-19]. Despite no longer having access to the original development resources from the Coktel Vision era, Gilhodes was determined to bring the goblins back for a new generation[^ref-2].

The project gained momentum through crowdfunding, with campaigns launched on both Ulule and Kickstarter in 2022[^ref-2]. The crowdfunding goal was set at €3,000, with the campaigns ultimately raising over €10,000 to support development[^ref-2]. Gilhodes acknowledged the importance of this community support: "Without this campaign, I would have still developed the game, but it would have been financially difficult"[^ref-2].

### Production

Development proceeded as a largely solo effort, with Gilhodes handling the vast majority of creative and technical work himself. The game was built using Adventure Game Studio (AGS), a free development toolkit popular among independent adventure game creators[^ref-5]. Despite not being a programmer by training, Gilhodes learned to work with the AGS engine to realize his vision[^ref-6].

The development process required Gilhodes to create all the artwork, design the puzzles, and implement the game logic. Forum observers noted that "Even though Pierre is not a programmer, he seems to be doing all the work with AGS"[^ref-6]. The decision to return to 2D visuals represented both a practical choice given the solo development constraints and an artistic statement, distancing the new game from the criticized 3D approach of Gobliiins 4[^ref-4].

Gilhodes' distinctive art style remained remarkably consistent with his earlier work, with community members observing that "Pierre's art style remained almost exactly the same over the years"[^ref-16]. The hand-drawn animations captured the whimsical, expressive quality that had defined the original trilogy's visual appeal[^ref-18].

**Development Credits:**[^ref-8]
- **Designer:** Pierre Gilhodes
- **Artist:** Pierre Gilhodes
- **Additional Art:** Marion Poinsot[^ref-6]

### Technical Achievements

The game achieved visual polish remarkable for a solo development project, featuring detailed 2D animation at 640×480 resolution[^ref-2]. The AGS engine provided a stable foundation for the point-and-click gameplay, supporting modern display features including widescreen resolutions and multi-monitor setups[^ref-9]. The game demonstrated that classic 2D adventure game aesthetics remained viable and appealing to modern audiences.

### Technical Issues

Several technical issues were reported by players following release. Some users experienced game crashes after completing level 4, with an error message reading "Unable to create local script: Runtime error: unresolved import 'ShellExecute'"[^ref-17]. Screen flickering was reported by users with G-Sync enabled displays[^ref-7].

The save system underwent changes during post-release updates. An F5 save feature was initially implemented but later disabled due to bugs, with save compatibility problems occurring between different game versions[^ref-7]. Players noted that some interactive elements in the environment were difficult to distinguish from non-interactive background elements[^ref-16].

Walk-behind graphic rendering presented ongoing challenges during development, with some graphical layering issues requiring patches[^ref-7]. Gilhodes continued to release updates addressing reported problems post-launch.

- The publisher name "Schnibble Productions" references Gilhodes' previous game Woodruff and the Schnibble of Azimuth[^ref-8]
- The first part of the game can be downloaded completely free, serving as both demo and the full first quarter of the experience[^ref-8]
- Gilhodes confirmed that Gobliiins 6 is already in development following the reception of Gobliiins 5[^ref-10]

## Voice Cast

Gobliiins 5 does not feature voice acting, maintaining the text-based presentation style of the classic entries in the series[^ref-10].

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Gobliiins 5's commercial performance was modest but respectable for an independent crowdfunded project. As one French gaming publication observed: "It can't be said that it caused a commercial tsunami on Steam. However, it seems to be well-received and appreciated as a nostalgic return to childhood"[^ref-2]. The game succeeded in reaching its target audience of nostalgic fans while also attracting some new players to the franchise[^ref-16].

The successful crowdfunding campaigns demonstrated continued interest in the classic adventure game format and the Gobliiins series specifically, even decades after the original games[^ref-2]. Community support on platforms like GOG.com's wishlist system showed demand for the game on additional storefronts[^ref-18].

### Collections

As of 2024, Gobliiins 5 remains available as a standalone digital release. The previous games in the series (Gobliiins 1-4) are available on GOG.com, though Gobliiins 5 had not yet been added to that platform[^ref-17]. The game is distributed through:
- Steam (full game and demo)[^ref-20]
- itch.io (developer's direct store)[^ref-10]

### Fan Projects

The game achieved compatibility with ScummVM, the popular open-source engine recreation project, expanding its potential platform support[^ref-10]. Community members undertook unofficial porting efforts, including Mac ports using modified ScummVM builds targeting various macOS versions from 10.9 through Apple Silicon[^ref-21]. A Reddit user offered to create optimized ports for additional platforms, stating: "I love all platforms equally and if I ever have the luck of being hired as a ports wizard in an official capacity... I'll do my darndest to deliver really optimized experiences for everybody"[^ref-21].

### Related Publications

Community-created resources emerged to support players:
- **Steam Guide Walkthrough:** Complete 16-level walkthrough by Flying Tom[^ref-22]
- **Walkthrough King Guide:** Text-based walkthrough covering Parts 1-3, updated January 2024[^ref-14]

### Critical Perspective

Gobliiins 5 occupies a unique position in adventure gaming history as a genuine sequel to a classic series, created by its original designer three decades after the first game. Unlike many revival projects that attempt to recapture past glory through corporate development, this was a passion project from the actual creator, funded directly by fans who remembered the original games fondly[^ref-2].

The game represents both the possibilities and limitations of solo independent development. While it successfully captured the spirit, humor, and gameplay style of the original trilogy, the rough edges inherent to a one-person project are evident[^ref-5]. Reviewers noted uneven quality across sections, with some parts being significantly stronger than others[^ref-16]. Yet this authenticity—the same creative voice behind the 1991 original crafting new content—gave the game a legitimacy that corporate revivals often lack.

Gobliiins 5 also demonstrated that demand exists for traditional 2D adventure games with unconventional puzzle design in an era dominated by more streamlined experiences. Its return to 2D after the unsuccessful 3D experiment of Gobliiins 4 validated the visual style that made the series memorable[^ref-5]. The game's modest success and the announcement of Gobliiins 6 suggest the franchise may continue as a niche but beloved series for dedicated fans[^ref-10].
