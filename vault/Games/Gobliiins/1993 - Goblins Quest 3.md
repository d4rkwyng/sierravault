# Goblins Quest 3

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

Goblins Quest 3 is the third and final installment in Coktel Vision's beloved Gobliiins puzzle-adventure series, released in 1993 for MS-DOS and Amiga platforms[^ref-1]. Described by Electronic Games magazine as "a cartoon cross between Indiana Jones and Ren and Stimpy," the game follows Blount, a goblin journalist covering the mysterious Labyrinth of Foliandre, who is "as tough and persistent as Indiana Jones" but "not much smarter than Ren and Stimpy"[^ref-2]. Sierra On-Line distributed the game in North America, adding the "Quest" suffix to align it with their popular Quest series branding, though it was originally released in Europe simply as "Goblins 3"[^ref-3].

The game represents a significant evolution for the series, featuring what Adventure Classic Gaming called "probably the most bizarre game in the series"[^ref-3]. Unlike its predecessors, which featured multiple controllable goblins (reflected in the number of "i"s in the title—Gobliiins had three, Gobliins 2 had two), Goblins Quest 3 focuses on a single protagonist, hence the single "i" in "Goblins"[^ref-1]. The game was marketed by Sierra as "a genuinely interactive Tex Avery style animated game" and was praised for its challenging puzzles, bright VGA graphics, and comedic charm[^ref-4]. PC Gamer declared that "its puzzles will challenge and delight even the most experienced gamers," while Computer Gaming World noted it was "designed to thoroughly amuse" and guaranteed "an enjoyably bizarre experience"[^ref-1].

## Story Summary

The game's narrative centers on the legendary Labyrinth of Foliandre, said to harbor great secrets that might fulfill the wishes of those who discover them[^ref-7]. For thousands of years, two kingdoms ruled by Queen Xina and King Bodd have competed fiercely to be the first to conquer the labyrinth in the bowels of Mount Foliandre[^ref-8]. According to legend, the goblin who manages to overcome all the tests in the labyrinth will win eternal benefit for their people, with the fabulous "Jewel of the World" at its heart securing an eternity of pleasure for its owner[^ref-9].

Players take control of Blount, a talented reporter from the "Goblins News" who becomes entangled in a series of catastrophic events[^ref-9]. The game opens with Blount awakening to discover his flying ship under attack—the captain and even the rats have abandoned ship[^ref-2]. Jumping overboard, Blount crashes to earth, is surrounded by guards, becomes smitten by love, defeats the guards, and is then devoured by a werewolf, waking up dead—"and that's just a tune-up for his real adventure," according to Electronic Games[^ref-2]. Strange events have begun occurring throughout the land: the guardian of the labyrinth has died, his daughter has disappeared, and King Bodd has apparently fallen under a mysterious curse[^ref-7].

After being bitten by a werewolf, Blount gains the ability to transform into a werewolf form when exposed to moonlight, giving him a dual personality[^ref-8]. Thanks to this double personality, he might have a chance to overcome the obstacles of the labyrinth and become the champion of both Xina and Bodd[^ref-8]. Throughout his journey, Blount must also deal with falling in love and having his beloved kidnapped, creating both romantic and heroic motivations[^ref-10]. In a clever series connection, Blount is revealed to be the little prince who was kidnapped in the previous game, Gobliins 2: The Prince Buffoon[^ref-11].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Goblins Quest 3 employs a point-and-click interface typical of early 1990s adventure games[^ref-12]. Players use the mouse to interact with objects, characters, and the environment, combining items in their inventory to solve puzzles[^ref-12]. The game utilizes "bright, expressive VGA graphics" running at 256 colors, with most areas being larger than the screen and therefore scrolling as players explore[^ref-1][^ref-11]. Unlike many adventure games of the era, Goblins Quest 3 features a "you-can't-die-no-matter-what-you-do" design philosophy, encouraging experimentation without fear of failure[^ref-12].

### Structure and Progression

The game consists of 18 different levels, with some levels being interconnected[^ref-11]. Most levels occupy more than one screen, allowing for limited navigation within confined puzzle areas[^ref-7]. Like its predecessors, the emphasis is on solving complex tasks within smaller areas rather than expansive exploration[^ref-7]. The game includes a joker system—five jokers are available that provide extra clues when players become stuck[^ref-13].

**Level Structure:**
- **The Vessel:** Opening sequence aboard Blount's flying ship[^ref-14]
- **The Countryside:** Aftermath of the crash landing[^ref-14]
- **The Town:** Urban environment with various characters[^ref-14]
- **The Clouds:** Elevated puzzle sequences[^ref-14]
- **The Labyrinth:** Final challenges within Mount Foliandre[^ref-8]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The puzzles in Goblins Quest 3 are designed to "test your brain power to the max," according to Gamer Walkthroughs[^ref-15]. While Blount is the primary controllable character, each level features a secondary character who assists in puzzle-solving but cannot pick up objects[^ref-8]. These sidekicks include Chump the parrot, Ooya the magician, and Fulbert the snake[^ref-11]. Players must coordinate actions between Blount and his current companion to solve the game's intricate puzzles.

A unique mechanic involves Blount's werewolf transformation. When exposed to moonlight, Blount spontaneously transforms into a werewolf, and the hero undergoes several other mutations, drastically changing his size during the course of the game[^ref-16]. Players must strategically use both forms to overcome obstacles. The game also features potion-crafting mechanics, with players creating various elixirs such as Growlixir, Speedixir, Wingixir, and Memorum throughout gameplay[^ref-14]. One puzzle notably requires restoring a dragon's memory with the Memorum potion before he will help the player[^ref-14].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Goblins Quest 3 received generally positive reviews upon release, though opinions varied somewhat between publications. Computer Gaming World awarded the game 3.5 out of 5 stars in their July 1994 review, praising its "charming characters and goofy plot elements" while noting that "puzzle lovers are guaranteed an enjoyably bizarre experience"[^ref-1]. Amiga User International gave the game an 85 out of 100 in April 1994, while Amiga Format scored it 80 out of 100 in February 1994[^ref-5]. Amiga Power awarded 77 out of 100 in February 1994, and Amiga Joker gave 74 out of 100 in January 1994[^ref-5].

The game received more mixed coverage from CU Amiga, which awarded only 53% in their February 1994 review by Tony Dillon[^ref-1]. PC Gamer was notably enthusiastic, declaring it one of the best puzzle games available and stating that "its puzzles will challenge and delight even the most experienced gamers"[^ref-1]. The game earned the distinction of being ranked as the 42nd best computer game ever by PC Gamer US in 1994, and also received their 1994 Best Puzzle Game award[^ref-1].

### Modern Assessment

Retrospective assessments have generally been favorable. Adventure Classic Gaming's Jess Beebe gave the game 4 out of 5 stars in a May 2010 review, calling it "a great finale to a great series"[^ref-3]. The reviewer praised the game's unique qualities while acknowledging some issues with the music not always fitting the locale or changing appropriately during scene transitions[^ref-3].

User reviews on various platforms have been consistently positive. MobyGames shows a critic score of 80% based on 25 ratings and a player score of 3.9 out of 5 based on 62 ratings[^ref-5]. The game holds a 4.63 out of 5 rating on MyAbandonware[^ref-17] and 4.00 out of 5 based on 34 votes on Abandonware DOS[^ref-2]. Amazon customer reviews show 4.8 out of 5 stars from 3 global ratings[^ref-18]. GameFAQs user Tastii awarded the game 7 out of 10 in their August 2000 review, calling it "a must-have game" that combines "great puzzle elements with witty humor"[^ref-12].

- **GameFAQs:** 7/10[^ref-12]

## Development

### Origins

Goblins Quest 3 was developed by Coktel Vision, a French game developer that had established the Gobliiins series in 1991[^ref-19]. The series was created by [[Pierre Gilhodes]] and [[Muriel Tramis]], with Gilhodes contributing the unique visual look that became the signature style of not only the Goblins games but many of Coktel Vision's other titles[^ref-19]. Gilhodes "became a graphic artist at a very early age" and began creating video games with Coktel Vision in 1990[^ref-20]. The conceptual premise of the series—where the number of "i"s in the title indicates the number of playable goblins—was cleverly carried through to its logical conclusion in this third installment[^ref-1].

### Production

The game was released in the US shortly after Sierra On-Line's acquisition of Coktel Vision, and Sierra's influence is apparent in the addition of the word "Quest" to the title, aligning it with Sierra's other popular Quest series[^ref-3]. This was the last Goblins game published by Sierra On-Line[^ref-8]. The development team crafted what the box described as "another mind-bending, plot-twisting, brain-teasing puzzle adventure"[^ref-13].

**Development Credits:**[^ref-5]
- **Created by:** Pierre Gilhodes, Muriel Tramis
- **Project Manager:** Muriel Tramis
- **Program Manager:** Emmanuel Maguet
- **Programming (M.D.O.):** C. Ganguillin, Roland Lacoste, Emmanuel Maguet
- **Graphics:** Jean-Christophe Charter, Rachid Chebli, Pierre Gilhodes, Christian Laly, Pascal Pautrot, Jeff Rey
- **Music & Sound Effects:** Charles Callet

### Technical Achievements

The game utilized Coktel Vision's proprietary Gob engine, which powered several of the studio's adventure titles[^ref-6]. The engine supported VGA 256-color graphics at 320x200 resolution, with scrolling screens that were larger than the display area[^ref-6][^ref-11]. A distinctive audio feature was the "goblinish" speech system—whenever characters spoke, their voices were rendered in gibberish sounds appropriate to each character, which "actually added a lot of funny moments to the game"[^ref-5]. The CD-ROM version later replaced this with actual voice acting featuring Sierra-style speech boxes[^ref-3].

### Version History

| Version | Date | Platform | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| 1.0 | 1993 | DOS/Amiga | Initial European release as "Goblins 3"[^ref-1] |
| US Release | March 18, 1994 | DOS | Sierra release with "Quest" suffix[^ref-21] |
| CD-ROM | 1994 | DOS | Added voice acting, different music, censored some nudity[^ref-1] |
| ScummVM | March 23, 2010 | Windows | Re-release with ScummVM compatibility[^ref-6] |
| GOG | 2018 | Windows | DotEmu re-release, version 1.02[^ref-22] |

### Technical Issues

The game has experienced various compatibility issues on modern systems. Users on VOGONS forums reported crashes occurring "a couple seconds after" starting the game on Windows XP systems[^ref-23]. The Coktel Vision games "just seem to not like the NT version of MSCDEX, MACDEXNT," according to community member "collector"[^ref-23]. The recommended solution is to use "SAPUCDEX with VDMSound," which makes "most of the Coktel Vision games seem to work even better than with Windows 9x or DOS 7"[^ref-23]. Modern players are advised to use ScummVM or the GOG re-release for optimal compatibility[^ref-4].

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- The protagonist Blount is revealed to be the kidnapped prince from Gobliins 2: The Prince Buffoon, creating a direct narrative connection between games[^ref-11]
- The game features copy protection using a color grid reference system[^ref-5]
- The Amiga version was deprived of some between-levels screens present in other versions[^ref-5]
- Characters speak in "goblinish"—gibberish sounds rendered in voices appropriate to each character—in the floppy disk version[^ref-5]
- The music in the floppy disk version is composed of entirely different tunes than the CD-ROM version[^ref-3]
- In Gobliins 2, Fingus will whistle a different tune in each room if left idle—a charming detail carried through the series' attention to character personality[^ref-19]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Goblins Quest 3 achieved notable recognition during its release era. PC Gamer US ranked it as the 42nd best computer game ever in 1994 and awarded it their Best Puzzle Game honor that same year[^ref-1]. The game also won the Amiga Joker Readers' Vote for #3 Best Genre Mix in 1994[^ref-5]. As the final entry in the original trilogy published by Sierra On-Line, it represented the culmination of Coktel Vision's puzzle-adventure formula[^ref-8].

### Collections

The game has been re-released digitally through various platforms. It is available on GOG.com through DotEmu, which handles modern distribution[^ref-22]. The entire Gobliiins series was also made available on Steam in July 2023, ensuring the games remain accessible to modern audiences[^ref-1]. The game can be played through ScummVM, which has supported the Gob engine since 2010[^ref-4].

### Fan Projects

The Gobliiins series has inspired continued development. Pierre Gilhodes himself created Gobliiins 5: The Morgloton Invasion using Adventure Game Studio, releasing it on both Steam and itch.io[^ref-24]. Gilhodes describes it as "a great adventure in 2D for all ages. 16 big levels full of puzzles"[^ref-24]. A sixth installment ([[2026 - Gobliins 6\|Gobliins 6]]) releases in 2026[^ref-24]. Community opinions on Gobliiins 4 (developed without Gilhodes' direct involvement) have been mixed, with some fans considering it "a 3D mistake"[^ref-13].

- **Various Walkthrough Guides:** Multiple fan-created walkthroughs are available on GameFAQs and dedicated gaming sites[^ref-14][^ref-15]

### Critical Perspective

Goblins Quest 3 occupies a distinctive place in adventure gaming history as a bridge between French and American game design sensibilities. Developed by Coktel Vision but distributed through Sierra On-Line's global network, it represents an important example of European creative talent reaching wider audiences during the golden age of point-and-click adventures. The game's emphasis on pure puzzle-solving over narrative exploration distinguished it from contemporaneous Sierra and LucasArts titles, appealing to players who wanted brain-teasing challenges wrapped in cartoon humor.

Modern critics recognize the game as "a great finale to a great series," noting that "it undoubtedly has the best story, the best graphics and animations, and the best music" of the trilogy[^ref-3][^ref-13]. The game's influence on puzzle-adventure design can be seen in its integration of character transformation mechanics, companion-based puzzle-solving, and commitment to player-friendly design that eliminated death penalties. While overshadowed in gaming history by larger Sierra franchises, Goblins Quest 3 remains beloved among adventure game enthusiasts and continues to find new audiences through digital distribution platforms.
