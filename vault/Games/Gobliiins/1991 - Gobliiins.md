<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

Gobliiins is a quirky point-and-click adventure/puzzle game developed by French studio Coktel Vision and released in 1991.[^ref-1] Created by [[Pierre Gilhodes]] and co-designed by [[Muriel Tramis]], this whimsical title became the beginning of Coktel Vision's most beloved franchise.[^ref-2] The game represents "a strange blend of genres that includes point and click adventure with more traditional puzzle-style gameplay," featuring players controlling three unique goblins, each with special abilities, as they solve creative puzzles and navigate humorous scenarios in a whimsical world filled with charm and wit.[^ref-3][^ref-4]

The game's distinctive naming convention—with three "i"s in the title—indicates the number of playable characters, a tradition that would continue throughout the series.[^ref-5] Gobliiins is notable for being "the very first game to feature more than one protagonist," pioneering the multi-character puzzle-solving mechanic that would influence later games like The Lost Vikings.[^ref-1] The linear game consists of 22 levels, each occupying a single screen, where players must coordinate the three goblins' distinct abilities to progress.[^ref-6]

"Large, detailed sprites bring this puzzler to life," noted one reviewer, adding that while "the challenges can be obtuse, the charm keeps you playing."[^ref-7] The game combines challenging environmental puzzles with slapstick humor, creating an experience described by critics as both entertaining and occasionally frustrating—"mind-boggling puzzles in a crazy, surreal world full of even crazier characters."[^ref-8]

## Story Summary

The kingdom of King Angoulafre has fallen into chaos as the beloved monarch has gone completely mad.[^ref-10] The cause of his insanity is sinister: someone is using a voodoo doll to drive the king crazy, slowly tormenting him with dark magic.[^ref-11] As the king's sanity deteriorates, the fate of the entire realm hangs in the balance, and only three brave goblins can hope to save him.

The story follows three goblins—Asgard the warrior, Ignatius the magician, and Oups the technician (known as BoBo, Hooter, and Dwayne respectively in the US release)—as they attempt to aid their afflicted king.[^ref-12] These "rather goofy elves from the Kingdom of King Angoulafre" must seek out the wizard Niak, who claims he can cure the king's madness if they bring him three magical items.[^ref-13] The goblins embark on their perilous quest, using their unique abilities to overcome the bizarre obstacles that stand in their way.

However, upon obtaining the required items, the goblins discover a terrible truth: Niak himself is revealed to be the villain behind the king's insanity, having manipulated the goblins into performing his bidding all along.[^ref-6] The three heroes must now escape from Niak's lair and find a way to save their king. In the climactic finale, the goblins manage to destroy the voodoo doll used to drive King Angoulafre insane and defeat Niak while he is creating deadly potions, restoring peace to the kingdom.[^ref-6]

The narrative unfolds largely without traditional dialogue, as characters speak in "goblinish"—a gibberish of sounds—forcing the game to convey its story through visual humor and physical comedy.[^ref-14] This approach made the game accessible to international audiences while contributing to its unique charm and surreal atmosphere.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Gobliiins employs a simplified point-and-click interface where players control three goblin characters, each with fundamentally different abilities.[^ref-1] Unlike traditional adventure games of the era that featured a single protagonist with multiple verbs, this game's design requires players to select which goblin to use and then click on objects or locations to interact.[^ref-3] The characters themselves embody the different actions: one can use objects, another can hit things, and the third uses magic.[^ref-2]

The goblins themselves feature charming visual personalities—"The goblins themselves look sort of loveable. Okay they are not exactly plush toy materials. But they are also not hideous looking either."[^ref-15] When players make mistakes or misuse items, "the goblins mock player when items are misused" and "become impatient when idle," adding personality to the gameplay experience.[^ref-16]

### Structure and Progression

The game is linear and consists of 22 levels, with each level occupying a single screen.[^ref-6] Players must solve all puzzles on the current screen before progressing to the next one.[^ref-7] Progress is saved through a password system rather than traditional save files—the game provides save codes when moving to the next screen.[^ref-11]

- **Levels 1-5:** Initial puzzles introducing the three goblins' abilities
- **Levels 6-10:** Increasingly complex environmental challenges
- **Levels 11-15:** Mid-game puzzles requiring precise coordination
- **Levels 16-20:** Advanced puzzle sequences leading to Niak's domain
- **Levels 21-22:** Final confrontation in Niak's lair[^ref-17]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Each goblin possesses unique abilities that must be combined strategically to solve environmental puzzles.[^ref-1] In the original European version, Asgard is the warrior who can punch and climb, Ignatius is the wizard who casts unpredictable spells, and Oups is the technician who can pick up and use items.[^ref-13] Only the technician character can hold objects, and he can only carry one item at a time.[^ref-11]

A distinctive feature is the shared health bar system. The three goblins share a collective life bar that decreases whenever they make mistakes or trigger traps.[^ref-8] "Every time you do something wrong, you lose energy," and "the goblins get hurt and complain to you about sending them into these traps. It's hilarious."[^ref-7][^ref-8] Some actions can kill goblins instantly, requiring careful planning.[^ref-11]

"Many of the puzzles seem like Rube Goldberg machines with an Escherian twist," noted one reviewer, highlighting the game's complex, interconnected puzzle design.[^ref-18] Critics have observed that "the puzzle solutions can be annoyingly strait-jacketed at times," requiring very specific sequences of actions.[^ref-19] One infamous example involves needing to "physically put a diamond into [a wizard's] hand—which is subject of a puzzle—when in his own self-interest he should just stoop down and pick up the diamond when you lay it at his feet."[^ref-20]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Upon release, Gobliiins received generally positive reviews, with critics praising its innovative multi-character gameplay and charming visual style while noting its challenging puzzle design. Power Play magazine gave the game 69/100 in March 1992.[^ref-21] Amiga Action awarded the game 81%, with reviewer Alan Bunker praising the detailed sprites and puzzle design.[^ref-7] Dragon magazine gave the game a perfect 5/5 score in 1993.[^ref-5]

Computer Gaming World noted that "the game will entertain a variety of light-hearted gamers," acknowledging both its appeal and niche audience.[^ref-5] ST Format ranked Gobliiins #33 in their "50 finest Atari ST games of all time" list in January 1993.[^ref-1]

Critics consistently praised the visual design and humor while acknowledging the difficulty. One contemporary reviewer called it "a landmark in computer gaming" and "a really neat game, super-original with no equal in that department."[^ref-1]

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospectives have been more mixed, with reviewers appreciating the nostalgic charm while acknowledging dated mechanics. Adventure Classic Gaming gave the original trilogy high marks, praising the series' creativity.[^ref-22] The GOG.com user community rates the Gobliiins Pack 4.4/5 stars.[^ref-8]

Some modern critics are less forgiving of the puzzle design. One blogger noted the game is "an interesting concept... marred by absurdly nonsensical puzzles and poor story logic."[^ref-20] Family Friendly Gaming gave the iOS port 76/100, with reviewer Paul admitting "it may have taken me months, but this point and click adventure now makes sense to me."[^ref-15]

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** 7.4/10[^ref-1]
- **IMDB:** 7.5/10[^ref-23]
- **GOG.com User Reviews:** 4.4/5[^ref-8]
- **Powerplay:** 70%[^ref-5]

## Development

### Origins

Pierre Gilhodes began his career as a graphic artist at a very early age and started creating video games with Coktel Vision in 1990.[^ref-24] The Gobliiins concept emerged from his distinctive angular and cartoonish art style combined with Muriel Tramis's adventure game design experience.[^ref-2] Gilhodes later described his approach as "the kidults style," creating content that appealed to both children and adults.[^ref-25]

The game's multi-character puzzle-solving concept was innovative for its time—"Gobliiins is the very first game to feature more than one protagonist."[^ref-1] The decision to use three characters with distinct abilities rather than one protagonist with multiple verbs created a unique gameplay dynamic that would define the series.

### Production

Development took place at Coktel Vision's French studios, with the team designing 22 single-screen puzzle environments.[^ref-2] The game's focus on visual storytelling with minimal dialogue was intentional, allowing the game to be more easily localized for international markets.[^ref-26] Characters speak in "goblinish," a gibberish language that required no translation while conveying emotion and intent through sound design.[^ref-14]

- **Co-Designer:** Muriel Tramis
- **Art Director:** Pierre Gilhodes
- **Programming:** Eric Metens, M.D.O., Roland Lacoste

- **Composer (CD-ROM):** Charles Callet
- **Development Tools:** C Code

### Technical Achievements

Gobliiins utilized Coktel Vision's proprietary "Gob" engine, which would continue to power subsequent entries in the series.[^ref-9] The game featured 256-color VGA graphics at 320x200 resolution, showcasing detailed character sprites and hand-painted backgrounds.[^ref-26]

The visual design earned particular praise, with "large, detailed sprites" bringing the puzzle-adventure to life.[^ref-7] Pierre Gilhodes's angular, cartoonish art style gave the game a distinctive look that set it apart from contemporaries, featuring characters "who are more like pixies or gnomes than your typical goblin."[^ref-27]

### Cut Content

Some music written by Frédéric Motte for Gobliiins was not used in the original 1991/1992 floppy releases. While the European boxes credited "Music and SFX: Moby (Frédéric Motte)," actually there was no music in the floppy versions.[^ref-1] This unused music was eventually used in Coktel Vision's "Once Upon a Time: Baba Yaga."[^ref-1]

The game also contains unused title screen music that can be found in the data files.[^ref-30]

|-------|------|---------|
| GOB1CD | 95.7 KB | CD version fixes for sound cards and CD-ROM drives |
| GOB1CDb | 81.2 KB | Patch disk included with CD release |

The Macintosh version has documented problems with music playback when running through ScummVM.[^ref-33] Modern users are advised to use ScummVM for the best compatibility experience—"Thanks to ScummVM, thousands of gamers around the world can enjoy the good old Goblins without any compatibility problems and headache."[^ref-34]

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- An eyeball can be seen peeking out of a jar in Niak's house with no story influence or consequence.[^ref-27]
- A small creature can be spotted spying on the characters during certain scenes with no gameplay consequences.[^ref-27]
- The characters speak in a made-up "goblinish" language throughout the game.[^ref-9]
- The intentional spelling of "Gobliiins" with three "i"s was a deliberate design choice by Coktel Vision to indicate the number of playable characters.[^ref-1]
- A SoftKey CD-ROM release incorrectly marked the game as a Windows product, though the disc contents were pure MS-DOS.[^ref-1]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

While specific sales figures are not publicly available, Gobliiins was successful enough to spawn a franchise spanning five main entries over three decades.[^ref-5] The original trilogy was published by Sierra On-Line, helping establish Coktel Vision as a notable developer in the adventure game genre.[^ref-35]

### Collections

Gobliiins has appeared in numerous compilation releases:

- **Gobliiins 1 & Gobliins 2** – Sierra Originals dual-pack (October 20, 1995)[^ref-29]
- **Gobliiins Pack** – GOG.com digital bundle including first three games[^ref-8]
- **Gobliiins Gold** – CD-ROM version with voice acting in multiple languages[^ref-11]

### Fan Projects

The ScummVM project provides extensive compatibility support for all Gobliiins games, allowing players to enjoy the series on modern systems.[^ref-34] "Playing the Gobliiins games has been fun over a decade ago, and stil is," noted ScummVM team member Max Horn.[^ref-34]

### Critical Perspective

Gobliiins holds a significant place in adventure gaming history as a pioneer of multi-character puzzle gameplay. While games like The Lost Vikings would later refine the formula, Coktel Vision's French-made adventure established the core concept of coordinating characters with distinct abilities to solve environmental puzzles.[^ref-44]

The game's influence extends beyond its mechanical innovations. Rock Paper Shotgun's retrospective notes the series' clever naming convention: "In this age of Thie4s and 2 Fast 2 Furiouses, I feel we can learn something from that back-to-front art."[^ref-37] The diminishing number of "i"s across sequels (three, two, one, then back to three) represented the changing number of playable characters—a creative approach to titling that remains memorable decades later.

Critics remain divided on whether the game's challenging puzzles represent clever design or frustrating obscurity. Modern players often approach the series with nostalgia—"I prefer to keep on believing that Goblins III was a game that spoke to me, rather than risk the reality that it was just one more 90% lateral thinking puzzle game full of wacky characters."[^ref-37] Yet despite these concerns, the series' charm continues to attract new players, as evidenced by successful Kickstarter campaigns for Gobliiins 5 and continued availability on digital platforms.[^ref-38]

## Series Overview

The Gobliiins series spans five main entries across three decades, each with a distinctive character count indicated by the number of "i"s in the title:[^ref-5]

| Game | Year | Characters | Notes |
|------|------|------------|-------|
| Gobliiins | 1991 | 3 | Asgard, Ignatius, Oups |
| Gobliins 2: The Prince Buffoon | 1992 | 2 | Fingus and Winkle |
| Goblins Quest 3 | 1993 | 1 | Blount (with companion characters) |
| Gobliiins 4 | 2009 | 3 | Tchoup, Stucco, Perluis |
| GOBLiiiNS5 | 2023 | 3 | Return of Asgard, Ignatius, Oups |

**Gobliins 2: The Prince Buffoon (1992)** reduced the playable cast to two characters with "different attitudes, one being straight man, the other a trickster."[^ref-18] The prince has been kidnapped by a demon called Amoniak, and players control Fingus (polite and intelligent) and Winkle (mischievous and athletic) to rescue him.[^ref-22][^ref-39]

**Goblins Quest 3 (1993)** featured a single protagonist, goblin journalist Blount, though he gains companion characters throughout his adventure involving two competing kingdoms and a mysterious labyrinth.[^ref-35] Critics consider it "the best game in the series, mainly because it introduces secondary characters you can control."[^ref-14]

**Gobliiins 4 (2009)** marked Pierre Gilhodes's return to the franchise after 15 years, developed by Société Pollene with 3D graphics.[^ref-40] Reception was mixed (54/100 Metacritic), with Adventure Gamers calling it "a quality throwback to the beloved twisted humor and weird puzzles of the original games."[^ref-41]

**GOBLiiiNS5 (2023)** was crowdfunded through Kickstarter, raising €7,774 from 450 backers.[^ref-38] Developed using Adventure Game Studio, it features the return of original characters Asgard, Ignatius, and Oups in a new adventure involving creatures being turned into potatoes.[^ref-42]

## See Also

Gobliiins established the franchise's core identity: whimsical, challenging puzzle-adventure gameplay with lovable goblin protagonists speaking in gibberish while navigating surreal, colorful worlds. The game introduced King Angoulafre's kingdom and the basic premise of goblins saving royalty from magical threats—themes that would recur throughout the series.

The game's success led directly to Gobliins 2: The Prince Buffoon, which refined the formula by removing the health meter system (allowing unlimited attempts at puzzles) and introducing two new goblin protagonists with contrasting personalities.[^ref-22] This sequel would prove equally influential, leading to the critically acclaimed Goblins Quest 3.

Pierre Gilhodes's continued involvement across all five games provides remarkable creative continuity—from the original 1991 release through the 2023 crowdfunded fifth entry, the series maintains his distinctive "kidults style" and commitment to "funny and clever quests."[^ref-25][^ref-24]
