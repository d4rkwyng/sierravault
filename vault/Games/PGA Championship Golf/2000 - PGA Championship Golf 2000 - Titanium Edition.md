## Overview

PGA Championship Golf 2000 Titanium Edition was a sports golf simulation video game developed by EA Salt Lake[^ref-26] and published by Sierra Entertainment[^ref-10]. Released in 2000[^ref-21] as an enhanced version of the original PGA Championship Golf 2000, the Titanium Edition featured significant improvements including seven new 18-hole golf courses and enhanced multiplayer functionality[^ref-11]. The game was also known by the alternate title "PGA Championship Golf 2001" in some markets[^ref-25].

As part of Sierra's sports game lineup during their Sierra Sports division era[^ref-23], PGA Championship Golf 2000 Titanium Edition represented the company's commitment to delivering comprehensive golf simulation experiences. The game featured innovative mouse-based swing controls that replaced traditional power meter clicking, offering players what the developers described as "a more visceral interface and (with practice) more direct control over the shot"[^ref-4]. This unique control scheme set it apart from other golf games of the era and became one of its defining characteristics.

## Story Summary

As a golf simulation game, PGA Championship Golf 2000 Titanium Edition focused on realistic golf gameplay rather than narrative storytelling. The game provided players with authentic golf course experiences, featuring both fantasy and real-life golf courses[^ref-5]. Players could engage in various golf play modes including skins, scramble, and best ball formats[^ref-4], creating their own sporting narratives through tournament play and course management.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The game's most distinctive feature was its revolutionary mouse-based swing control system. Instead of using traditional power meters common in other golf games, players controlled their golf swings through mouse movements[^ref-4]. This innovative approach provided what developers described as "a more visceral interface and (with practice) more direct control over the shot"[^ref-5], allowing for more nuanced and realistic golf gameplay.

The game supported multiple input devices including keyboard and mouse[^ref-21], and featured extensive customization options with dozens of available settings[^ref-5]. Players could adjust various aspects of their gameplay experience to match their skill level and preferences.

### Structure and Progression

PGA Championship Golf 2000 Titanium Edition offered multiple gameplay modes and extensive course selection. The Titanium Edition specifically included seven new exclusive 18-hole golf courses beyond the original game's content[^ref-4], providing substantial additional content for players. The enhanced version also featured an expanded art library for the Course Architect tool and improved multiplayer linking technology for smoother multiplayer experiences[^ref-21].

The game supported various multiplayer options including Internet, LAN, and modem connections[^ref-21], allowing players to compete against friends and other golf enthusiasts. Additional features included local co-op, online co-op, LAN competitive play, and local split screen modes[^ref-12].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

While not featuring traditional puzzles, the game presented players with the complex challenge of realistic golf course management. Players had to consider factors such as wind conditions, course terrain, club selection, and swing mechanics to achieve successful shots. The mouse-based swing system required players to develop precise timing and control, creating a skill-based progression system that rewarded practice and refinement.

The game was categorized as a third-person, sandbox sports game[^ref-25], giving players freedom to approach each hole and course according to their strategic preferences. This open-ended approach to golf simulation allowed for varied gameplay experiences and encouraged experimentation with different techniques and strategies.

Sierra Entertainment and Sierra On-Line, Inc. handled publishing duties[^ref-21], ensuring wide distribution across PC platforms.

The production timeline involved multiple release dates and regional variations. The initial Titanium Edition launched on June 1, 2000[^ref-10], followed by additional standard and collectors editions throughout 2000 and 2001[^ref-10]. International releases, including a German version in 2001[^ref-23], expanded the game's global reach.
