## Overview

Hi-Res Adventure #2: The Wizard and the Princess (also known as The Wizard and the Princess with a leading article) is a graphic adventure game written for the Apple II and published in September 1980 by [[On-Line Systems]][^ref-1]. Designed by [[Roberta Williams]] and programmed by [[Ken Williams]], it is the second installment in the [[1980 - Hi-Res Adventure 1 - Mystery House|Hi-Res Adventure Series]] series after [[1980 - Hi-Res Adventure 1 - Mystery House|Mystery House]][^ref-2]. Unlike its predecessor, which featured monochrome drawings, Wizard and the Princess introduced color graphics to the adventure game genre, becoming the first adventure game to feature full-color graphics[^ref-3][^ref-11].

The game sold over 60,000 copies[^ref-3][^ref-5], making it one of the best-selling computer games of its era. Debuting in August 1980, it had already sold 25,000 copies by June 1982, tying for fourth on Computer Gaming World's list of top sellers[^ref-4]. This commercial success was crucial in establishing Sierra On-Line as a major force in the adventure game market and provided funding for future, more ambitious projects[^ref-5][^ref-9].

This pioneering title served as a precursor to Sierra On-Line's legendary [[1984 - King's Quest - Quest for the Crown]] series, taking place in the land of Serenia—a setting that would return in [[1990 - King's Quest V - Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder|King's Quest V]][^ref-6]. The game's story was based on the many fairy tales Roberta Williams read as a child[^ref-7], establishing the fairy tale adventure formula that would define many of Sierra's greatest successes.

## Story Summary

The game takes place in the land of Serenia, ruled by King George IV[^ref-10]. According to the back cover of the original Atari 8-bit and Apple II versions, King George's daughter Princess Priscilla has been kidnapped by an evil wizard named Harlin, who holds her in his castle far in the mountains[^ref-8]. The King has offered half of his kingdom to anyone brave enough to travel to the Wizard's castle, defeat him, and return his daughter[^ref-8]. The player assumes the role of a happy wanderer who answers this noble challenge.

The rereleased ports for Apple II, Atari 8-bit, and Commodore 64 contain additional plot added to the manual explaining how the wanderer made it to Serenia[^ref-8]. In this expanded backstory, long after Harlin had been defeated by the Wanderer, he challenged the player to again repeat the actions leading to his defeat. He boasted of using his magic to change the world, creating obstacles for anyone who would challenge him—he moved the desert around the village of Daventry, split Serenia in two with a northern sea, and created Great Mountains in the North on his half of the continent[^ref-8].

Harlin turned back the sands of time, leaving the adventurer in the desert just outside the village of Serenia. He mocks the hero, telling him he may have been defeated once, but couldn't be defeated a second time. The princess gives the hero words of advice and a computer to help him defeat Harlin, telling him he has become the wanderer—creating an intriguing grandfather paradox and bootstrap paradox situation[^ref-8]. This expanded story was also included with the Roberta Williams Collection and the King's Quest Collection Series[^ref-8].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The player interacts with the game by entering simple commands to navigate, collect objects, solve puzzles, and interact with other characters to advance the story[^ref-11]. Players explore and manipulate objects by typing in one or two-word phrases such as "NORTH" or "GET KNIFE"[^ref-12]. The game features a two-word parser for text input, standard for early Sierra adventures[^ref-13].

The game displays both graphics and text on screen simultaneously, with the colorful scene illustrations appearing above the text interface area[^ref-14]. This split-screen format became a standard approach for graphic adventures of the era, balancing visual presentation with the textual interaction that adventure game fans expected.

### Structure and Progression

The adventure takes players on a journey across the land of Serenia, requiring them to cross deserts, oceans, and mountains, travel to an island, and encounter many strange beasts[^ref-15]. Players must learn magic, navigate at sea, and dig for treasure to ultimately reach Harlin's castle and rescue Princess Priscilla[^ref-15]. The game allowed saving game status to disk, which was an advanced feature for its time[^ref-5].

The non-linear nature of the game meant players could explore different areas and solve puzzles in varying orders, though certain items and knowledge needed to be acquired before others. This structure would influence Sierra's later adventure game design philosophy.

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Computer Gaming World noted that "The Wizard and the Princess has the best graphics and has a beautiful fairy tale setting as its theme. Of the three [Hi-Res Adventures] it was the most challenging and should be attempted only after you are familiar with the gaming system"[^ref-16]. The game's difficulty was compared favorably to Scott Adams' efforts by Creative Computing[^ref-17].

Like other early Sierra adventures, death was an ever-present threat, and players needed to think carefully about their actions. The puzzle design combined environmental challenges, item-based solutions, and the occasional bit of magic that Roberta Williams would expand upon in later works.

### Contemporary Assessment

Mark Marlow reviewed Mission: Asteroid, Mystery House, and The Wizard and the Princess for Computer Gaming World, declaring that "The Wizard and the Princess has the best graphics and has a beautiful fairy tale setting as its theme. Of the three it was the most challenging and should be attempted only after you are familiar with the gaming system"[^ref-16].

Ian Chadwick, reviewing the game for Ares Magazine #11, enthused that "if you're any fan of computer adventures, then this is one of the most amazing, intriguing, fascinating, frustrating and graphically appealing adventures around"[^ref-19]. The game's combination of charming fairy tale aesthetics with challenging gameplay clearly resonated with the adventure gaming audience of the early 1980s.

Creative Computing approved of the Atari version's graphics and compared its difficulty favorably to "some of Scott Adams' efforts"[^ref-17], high praise given Adams' reputation as a master of the adventure game genre. The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984 gave the game an overall B rating, prophetically stating that it "may well set a standard by which future graphic adventure games will be judged"[^ref-18].

### Sales Performance

The game's commercial success exceeded all expectations. Debuting in August 1980, it sold 25,000 copies by June 1982, tying for fourth on Computer Gaming World's list of top sellers at that time[^ref-4]. The game ultimately sold over 60,000 copies in total[^ref-3], establishing it as one of the best-selling computer games of the early 1980s and providing crucial capital for Sierra's continued growth.

## Development

### Origins

The Wizard and the Princess was written by Roberta Williams in 1980, building on the success of Mystery House earlier that year[^ref-5]. The story was based on the many fairy tales she used to read as a child[^ref-7], establishing a creative foundation that would inform much of her subsequent work at Sierra. Ken Williams handled the programming, as he had for Mystery House.

As with Mystery House, Wizard and the Princess was initially distributed by On-Line Systems in plastic bags containing a 5¼-inch floppy disk and instruction sheet[^ref-8]. The instruction sheet had the title listed as "The Wizard and the Princess" with the leading article, though marketing materials varied in their use of the article.

### Technical Innovation

The game significantly improved upon Mystery House by adding color graphics[^ref-3]. It was the first adventure game to have full-color graphics[^ref-3], a major technical achievement. The Apple II could only display six different colors simultaneously, but clever use of dithering made it possible to give the illusion of more colors on the screen[^ref-8], showcasing the technical ingenuity that would characterize Sierra's development approach.

The graphics were created by Roberta Williams using a simple line-drawing program[^ref-11], with hand-drawn color graphics that brought the fairy tale world of Serenia to life. This visual approach would influence adventure game development throughout the industry and prompt a broader focus on graphical presentation[^ref-20].

### Ports and Variations

Wizard and the Princess was ported to the IBM PC in 1982, becoming Sierra's first game for the PC platform[^ref-8]. For unknown reasons, this version was re-titled "Adventure in Serenia." Roberta Williams reputedly referred to the colors on the IBM PC as "atrocious" upon seeing the completed game running for the first time[^ref-8]. Adventure in Serenia was later announced as a launch title for the IBM PCjr in late 1983[^ref-21].

The Commodore 64 version, released in 1984, used more on-screen colors with solid colors and no dithering[^ref-8]. The items in the game were more detailed, and alternate artwork used higher resolution. The game was also ported to various Japanese computers by Starcraft, which completely redrew the artwork with more colors and higher resolution[^ref-8], demonstrating international interest in Sierra's pioneering adventure games.

## Legacy

### Influence on the Industry

Wizard and the Princess is recognized for pioneering color graphics in adventure games, offering more detailed and vibrant visuals than any previous title. This technological advancement not only enhanced player immersion but also influenced other developers, prompting a broader industry focus on graphical development[^ref-20]. The game helped establish that visual presentation was a crucial element of the adventure game experience.

### Connection to King's Quest

According to Sierra's Interaction magazine, this game can be considered a prelude to the King's Quest series[^ref-6]. King's Quest V marked a return to the Kingdom of Serenia, creating a direct narrative link between Williams' early work and her later masterpieces[^ref-6].

The events of Wizard and the Princess are mentioned and expanded upon in The King's Quest Companion, 2nd Edition[^ref-22]. This guide revealed that the wanderer, described as a barbarian, had turned down the offer of marriage after saving the princess. He journeyed into the desert and died, with only his skeleton and a single leather shoe remaining—a reference that appears in KQ5[^ref-22]. Princess Priscilla later married an individual named Kenneth the Huge and became the queen of Serenia after her father King George IV's death[^ref-22].

The game was further referenced as part of the King's Quest series through a trivia question in the King's Questions game that came with certain versions of the King's Quest Collection[^ref-22].

### Geographical Retcon

The extended backstory for Wizard and the Princess in the rereleases helps explain the geographic differences between the game and later titles in the King's Quest series[^ref-8]. In KQ5, Serenia and Daventry are part of the same continent, while in KQ3, the continent consists mostly of Daventry only with most of the northern half missing.

According to Wizard and the Princess, Harlin had divided the continent of Serenia in two and transformed the geography to create obstacles for adventurers[^ref-8]. This explains why the desert surrounds the village in the earlier game but not during KQ5, or why the Great Mountains are located across the sea on Harlin's continent but just north of the town in KQ5. By the time of KQ5, Harlin's magic was no longer active and geography was restored[^ref-8]. The King's Quest Companion places the events of Wizard and the Princess as having occurred several years before KQ5[^ref-22].

## See Also

Hi-Res Adventure 2 - The Wizard and the Princess connects narratively to its predecessor, Hi-Res Adventure 1 - Mystery House, through the establishment of the Hi-Res Adventure series, with Roberta Williams building upon her experience in crafting engaging adventure games. Mechanically, The Wizard and the Princess introduces color graphics, a significant improvement over the monochrome drawings in Mystery House, setting a new standard for the series. This evolution in graphics capabilities would continue to influence the development of subsequent games in the series.

The Wizard and the Princess also lays groundwork for future Sierra titles, particularly the King's Quest series, by introducing the land of Serenia, which would later appear in King's Quest V. The game's fairy tale-inspired storyline, based on Roberta Williams' childhood readings, establishes a formula that would define many of Sierra's successes, including the beloved King's Quest games. Furthermore, the game's engine, ADL, and its two-word parser for text input would be refined and built upon in subsequent Sierra adventures.

In terms of mechanical evolution, The Wizard and the Princess paves the way for more complex gameplay and storytelling in future series entries, such as Hi-Res Cribbage, which would likely build upon the graphical and interactive foundations established by The Wizard and the Princess. Although Hi-Res Cribbage may seem like a departure from the adventure genre, it is likely that the experience gained from developing The Wizard and the Princess influenced the design and implementation of this subsequent title, potentially incorporating similar graphical or user interface elements. The success of The Wizard and the Princess, with its sales of over 60,000 copies, provided crucial funding for Sierra to explore new projects and genres, ultimately contributing to the diversity of their game lineup.
