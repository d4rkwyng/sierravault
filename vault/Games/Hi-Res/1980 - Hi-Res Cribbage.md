## Story Summary

As a card game simulation, Hi-Res Cribbage does not feature a narrative story in the traditional sense. The game instead recreates the experience of playing cribbage, a card game with origins dating back to 17th century England, attributed to the poet Sir John Suckling.[^ref-6]

Players engage in matches against a computer opponent, with the goal of reaching 121 points before their adversary. The computer AI was designed to evaluate hands using 12 major rules, providing a challenging opponent for even experienced cribbage players.[^ref-6] The game warns players that "if you're not careful, and don't play your cards right, the computer will skunk you," referring to the cribbage term for a decisive victory.[^ref-4]

A complete match ends once either the player or the computer has won six rounds, creating a tournament-style structure for extended play sessions.[^ref-3] This format provided meaningful long-term goals beyond individual hands, encouraging players to develop and refine their strategies over multiple games.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Hi-Res Cribbage utilizes a keyboard-based text parser interface combined with high-resolution graphical display.[^ref-3] The game presents a top-down perspective of the playing surface with a fixed, flip-screen visual style.[^ref-3] Players input their card selections and decisions through the keyboard while viewing animated card graphics on screen.[^ref-3]

The game includes complete instructions for beginners, making it accessible to players unfamiliar with cribbage rules while still providing strategic depth for experienced players.[^ref-4] The interface handles all scoring automatically, removing the need for players to calculate points manually—a significant convenience given cribbage's complex scoring system.

### Structure and Progression

The game operates on a match-based structure where victory requires winning six individual rounds against the computer opponent.[^ref-3] Each round follows standard cribbage rules, with players attempting to reach 121 points through combinations of cards during play and in hand scoring.

Key features of the game structure include:

- **Automatic Card Dealing:** Cards are dealt randomly with visual animation simulating a real dealer.[^ref-4]
- **Visual Cribbage Board:** Scores are tracked on a graphical representation of a traditional cribbage board.[^ref-3]
- **Audible Pegging:** Points are registered with audio feedback as they are scored.[^ref-3]
- **Save Game Function:** Matches can be saved to disk to be resumed at a later time, a notable feature for the era.[^ref-3]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

While not featuring puzzles in the adventure game sense, Hi-Res Cribbage requires strategic decision-making typical of card games. The computer opponent was programmed with an algorithm capable of evaluating hands by 12 major rules, creating meaningful strategic challenges.[^ref-6]

Players must make decisions about which cards to discard to the crib, how to play cards during the pegging phase to maximize points and minimize opponent scoring, and when to employ defensive versus aggressive strategies. The game's AI was specifically designed to "challenge even the best Cribbage player."[^ref-4]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Contemporary review data from the original 1980 release period is limited in the available research. The game's quality was notable enough that Ken Williams, co-founder of On-Line Systems, assessed that "the game was surprisingly well done with crisp graphics and well-crafted logic."[^ref-6] This positive evaluation from Williams led directly to Schwader's hiring by the company.

### Modern Assessment

Modern game database communities have preserved information about Hi-Res Cribbage, though comprehensive reviews remain scarce due to the game's age and obscurity.

## Development

### Origins

Hi-Res Cribbage was developed by Warren Schwader during a unique period in his life. Schwader was caring for his disabled brother, who had been paralyzed in a car accident and had purchased one of the first Apple II computers.[^ref-6] Schwader was funded by state money for caregiving during this time, which gave him the opportunity to learn programming and develop games.[^ref-5]

The motivation for creating Hi-Res Cribbage was personal and practical: Schwader "often didn't have anyone to play cribbage against," so he created a computer opponent.[^ref-6] The game was developed after his previous title, Smash-Up, as Schwader continued to develop his programming skills.[^ref-6]

### Production

Schwader wrote Hi-Res Cribbage using the Apple II's built-in mini-assembler, demonstrating impressive technical skill for the era.[^ref-6] At the time, only a few programmers had the knowledge, let alone the skills, to write effective and usable software in assembly language and utilize the Apple II's Hi-Res graphics mode.[^ref-6]

The development of the computer AI required particular attention. Schwader implemented an algorithm capable of evaluating hands by 12 major rules, creating a computer opponent that could provide genuine challenge to experienced players.[^ref-6] This level of AI sophistication was notable for consumer software of the period.
