# Hi-Res Adventure #1: Mystery House

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 30, 2026</small>

## Overview

Mystery House is a landmark adventure game released by On-Line Systems on May 5, 1980[^ref-1]. Designed, written, and illustrated by [[Roberta Williams]] and programmed by [[Ken Williams]] for the Apple II[^ref-2], Mystery House holds the distinction of being the first graphical adventure game ever created and the first game produced by On-Line Systems[^ref-3], the company that would evolve into [[Sierra On-Line]]. The game is also recognized as one of the earliest horror video games[^ref-4], establishing many conventions that would define the graphic adventure genre[^ref-5].

The game places the player near an abandoned Victorian mansion where they become locked inside with seven strangers[^ref-6]. What begins as a treasure hunt for hidden jewels quickly transforms into a murder mystery as bodies begin appearing throughout the house[^ref-1]. Taking inspiration from Agatha Christie's novel "And Then There Were None" and the board game Clue[^ref-7][^ref-8], Mystery House established narrative conventions that would influence countless adventure games and horror titles for decades to come.

Originally packaged in Ziploc bags containing a floppy disk and photocopied instructions and sold for $24.95[^ref-9], what Roberta Williams initially considered a hobby project would go on to sell more than 10,000 copies through mail-order[^ref-10], eventually reaching 80,000 units sold worldwide including its 1982 SierraVenture re-release[^ref-8]. The game's success launched what would become one of the most important adventure game companies in gaming history.

## Story Summary

Mystery House opens with the player arriving at an abandoned Victorian mansion on a dark and stormy night[^ref-6]. Upon entering, they encounter seven strangers gathered in the entrance hall: Tom, a plumber; Sam, a mechanic; Sally, a seamstress; Dr. Green, a surgeon; Joe, a grave-digger; Bill, a butcher; and Daisy, a cook[^ref-1]. The diverse cast of characters, each with their own profession and potential motive, immediately evokes the classic whodunit setup.

The player soon discovers that a cache of valuable jewels is hidden somewhere within the mansion's many rooms[^ref-6]. However, the treasure hunt quickly takes a sinister turn as the other guests begin dying one by one under mysterious circumstances. Dead bodies start appearing throughout the house, making it clear that a murderer is on the loose[^ref-1]. The player must explore the mansion, gather clues, and identify the killer before becoming the next victim.

The narrative draws heavily from classic murder mystery conventions established by Agatha Christie's "And Then There Were None"[^ref-7], creating an atmosphere of paranoia and suspicion as the body count rises. The wonderfully Victorian setting[^ref-5] provides a suitably gothic backdrop for the unfolding mystery, with its dark corridors, secret passages, and hidden dangers. The game includes an outdoor maze and a crucial early puzzle with a time limit that adds urgency to the investigation[^ref-14].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls
Mystery House featured a two-word text parser that allowed players to input simple commands to navigate and interact with the game world[^ref-5]. Players could type directions like "GO NORTH" or "OPEN DOOR" to explore the mansion and examine objects. The game was controlled entirely through keyboard input[^ref-5] and supported single-player gameplay. While the parser was considered substandard even for its time compared to contemporary text adventures[^ref-14], it provided the essential interactivity needed for the pioneering graphical format.

### Structure and Progression
The game combined text-based adventure elements with simple graphical representations of each location, displaying a depiction of the character's current room above the text interface[^ref-9]. Players explored the Victorian mansion systematically, uncovering clues and solving puzzles to progress through the mystery. Mystery House established the fundamental structure that would define graphic adventures: a visual representation of the game world paired with text-based input and output.

The game is considerably more difficult than its predecessor Mission Asteroid and provides many traps for the unwary[^ref-5], requiring careful attention to detail and methodical exploration. Players can die at unexpected moments[^ref-14], adding tension to every interaction. The mansion contains numerous interesting rooms to explore, each rendered in the game's distinctive line-art style and potentially hiding clues, treasures, or deadly dangers.

### Puzzles and Mechanics
Mystery House featured traditional adventure game mechanics where players must collect items, solve puzzles, and piece together clues to solve the central mystery. The gameplay revolves around discovering the location of the expensive jewelry hidden within the mansion[^ref-6] while simultaneously investigating the murders. The first-person, fixed-perspective view[^ref-12] immerses players in the claustrophobic mansion environment.

The game includes an outdoor maze section that requires careful mapping and navigation[^ref-14]. Puzzle elements are integrated with the detective mystery theme[^ref-12], requiring players to examine crime scenes, gather evidence, and ultimately confront the murderer. The interactive fiction aspects demand logical thinking and attention to environmental details, while the horror elements keep players on edge throughout.

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Computer Gaming World | Positive | "Considerably more difficult... wonderfully Victorian setting"[^ref-5] |
| MyAbandonware | 4.07/5 | User ratings from 15 votes[^ref-12] |
| MobyGames | 6.8/10 | Community score[^ref-13] |
| IMDb | 5.3/10 | User ratings[^ref-15] |

### Contemporary Assessment
Mark Marlow reviewed Mystery House alongside Mission Asteroid and The Wizard and the Princess for Computer Gaming World in 1982, noting that "Mystery House is considerably more difficult and provides many traps for the unwary in a wonderfully Victorian setting"[^ref-5]. The review praised the game's atmosphere and challenge level, positioning it as a more substantial experience than the introductory Mission Asteroid.

### Sales Performance
To the Williamses' surprise, what Roberta had initially considered a hobby project sold more than 10,000 copies through mail-order[^ref-10][^ref-7]. Including its 1982 re-release through the SierraVenture line, 80,000 units were eventually sold worldwide[^ref-8], making it one of the best-selling computer games of its era. The game's commercial success demonstrated the viability of graphical adventure games and provided the financial foundation for On-Line Systems' growth.

### Modern Assessment
Computer Gaming World in 1996 ranked Mystery House fourth on the magazine's list of the most innovative computer games ever created[^ref-16], acknowledging its pioneering role in establishing the graphic adventure genre. GamePro named Mystery House the 51st most important game of all time in 2007, specifically citing its introduction of a visual component to adventure games and featuring graphics at a time when most computer games did not[^ref-17].

Modern reviewers acknowledge that the game hasn't weathered as well as purely text-based classics like Adventure and Zork[^ref-14]. The graphics are crude by any standard, and the parser is limited even compared to its contemporaries. However, the game's historical significance remains undeniable. Baf's Guide notes it's "interesting to see where the Sierra empire got started," describing it as "a bloody little story involving a search for jewels in an old house" that shares thematic DNA with later Sierra titles like The Colonel's Bequest[^ref-14].

## Development

### Origins and Inspiration
At the end of the 1970s, Ken Williams was working to establish a company developing enterprise software for the market-dominating Apple II computer[^ref-7]. One day, he brought a teletype terminal home to work on an accounting program. Browsing through a software catalog, he discovered a game called Colossal Cave Adventure[^ref-7]. Ken purchased the game and introduced it to his wife Roberta, and the couple became engrossed in playing through it together.

After completing Adventure, the Williams couple searched for similar games but found the market underdeveloped[^ref-7]. Roberta decided she could write her own adventure game and conceived the plot for Mystery House, drawing inspiration from Agatha Christie's classic novel "And Then There Were None"[^ref-7][^ref-6]. She was also inspired by the board game Clue, which helped her break away from a linear structure to create a more open-ended mystery[^ref-8].

### Production and Programming
Recognizing that while she knew some programming, she needed someone else to code the game, Roberta convinced her husband Ken to help[^ref-7]. Ken agreed and borrowed his brother's Apple II computer to write the game on. Ken suggested that adding graphical scenes to the otherwise text-based game would make it more interesting for players[^ref-7], a decision that would prove revolutionary for the genre.

To create the graphics, the couple purchased a VersaWriter machine, a device that allowed users to trace over line drawings and convert them to digital format[^ref-9]. Roberta drew seventy scenes for the game by hand[^ref-9], depicting the various rooms and locations within the Victorian mansion. However, Ken discovered that the resulting digital drawings were too large to fit on a 5¼-inch floppy disk[^ref-9].

### Technical Innovation
Ken devised an ingenious solution: instead of storing the images as static graphics, he converted them into coordinates and instructions that the program could use to redraw the lines of each scene dynamically[^ref-9]. He also wrote an improved version of the VersaWriter scanning software to facilitate this process. This innovative approach allowed all 70 drawings to fit within the game's limited storage space while maintaining visual quality.

The resulting game combined text-based adventure gameplay with a visual depiction of the character's location displayed above the text interface[^ref-9]. The game's code was completed in only a few days, with development finishing on May 5, 1980[^ref-9]. The entire game occupied just 58 KB of disk space, a remarkable achievement of efficient programming.

### Distribution
The Williams couple took out an advertisement in Micro magazine as "On-Line Systems" and began mass-producing their game[^ref-9]. The initial distribution method was decidedly low-tech: Ziploc bags containing a 5¼-inch floppy disk and a photocopied sheet of instructions, sold for $24.95[^ref-9] (equivalent to approximately $95 in 2024). The game was initially available in only four stores in Los Angeles county before word of mouth and mail orders dramatically expanded its reach.

## Legacy

### Industry Impact
Mystery House's success fundamentally changed the landscape of computer gaming. The game launched what would become the Hi-Res Adventures series[^ref-7], with On-Line Systems retroactively labeling it as "Hi-Res Adventure #1." The follow-on success of their next game, The Wizard and the Princess, convinced the Williams to move into game development full-time[^ref-7]. On-Line Systems was incorporated in 1980 as Sierra On-Line, beginning one of the most storied chapters in gaming history.

The game established many conventions for graphic adventure games[^ref-5] that would influence the genre for decades. Elements from Mystery House were later reintroduced in the Sierra On-Line game The Colonel's Bequest in 1989[^ref-1], which shared the game's murder mystery premise and slowly diminishing cast of suspects. The game is also considered one of the first where exploration of a strange house with hidden secrets is a central gameplay element—a concept that would later appear in series like Resident Evil, Gone Home, Castlevania, and What Remains of Edith Finch[^ref-18].

### Japanese Versions
Mystery House spawned significant interest in Japan, leading to several related releases[^ref-19]. In 1982, MicroCabin released an unrelated but inspired game also titled Mystery House. The following year, Japanese company Starcraft released an enhanced remake of the original On-Line Systems game with more realistic artwork and depictions of blood for the NEC PC-6001 and PC-8801[^ref-19]. MicroCabin later released Mystery House II for the MSX as a sequel to their own version. The Japanese versions of Mystery House collectively sold 50,000 units across various platforms[^ref-20].

### Public Domain Release
In 1987, Mystery House was released into the public domain as part of Sierra's seventh anniversary celebration[^ref-21][^ref-22]. Ken and Roberta Williams encouraged players to "copy this game for yourself or to share"[^ref-13], making it freely accessible for future generations. This decision ensured the game's preservation and allowed it to become an important artifact for studying the origins of graphic adventure games.

### Cultural Impact
Mystery House was satirized in the 1982 adventure game Prisoner 2, which featured a spooky house location where the player is told "He's killed Ken!" and must seek absolution for murder[^ref-1]. The game has also inspired numerous modern adaptations and artistic reinterpretations through the "Mystery House Taken Over" collaborative project[^ref-23], including works by notable interactive fiction authors like Emily Short and Nick Montfort.

In 2009, Mystery House was ported to iOS, introducing the pioneering title to a new generation of mobile gamers[^ref-21]. The port demonstrated continued interest in the game's historical significance nearly three decades after its original release.
