# Hi-Res Adventure #3: Cranston Manor

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 30, 2026</small>

## Overview

Hi-Res Adventure #3: Cranston Manor is a text-and-graphics adventure game released in 1981 by On-Line Systems, the company that would later become Sierra On-Line[^ref-1]. As the third numbered entry in the Hi-Res Adventures series—though technically the fourth game released in the series—Cranston Manor holds a unique distinction as the first Hi-Res Adventure not to involve [[Roberta Williams]] in its development[^ref-2]. This allowed Williams to focus her creative energies on the ambitious Hi-Res Adventure #5: Time Zone while Harold DeWitz and Ken Williams brought Lord Cranston's haunted estate to life[^ref-2].

The game challenges players to infiltrate a mansion once occupied by a late millionaire and recover sixteen treasures hidden throughout the property[^ref-3]. Set in the fictional town of Coarsegold—the same California town where On-Line Systems was headquartered—Cranston Manor blends treasure hunting with supernatural elements[^ref-4]. The mysterious Lord Cranston "had lived a life of excessive luxury, pleasure and sin, and knew that soon he would end up 'paying the piper'"[^ref-2], and rumors persist that his disembodied spirit still roams the estate, guarding his hidden riches[^ref-2].

Before Sierra became famous for their revolutionary King's Quest series, the Hi-Res Adventures represented the company's pioneering efforts in combining graphics with text-based adventure gameplay on home computers[^ref-4]. Cranston Manor exemplifies the early era of graphical adventures, featuring color hi-res graphics that could be toggled with a purely text-based mode, giving players flexibility in how they experienced the game[^ref-5].

## Story Summary

The narrative of Cranston Manor centers on the mysterious legacy of Lord Cranston, a wealthy figure whose fortune was acquired through questionable means. "Exactly how he made his fortune is unknown (it appears he wasn't a man known for either scruples or morals)"[^ref-2]. As death approached, the unscrupulous millionaire took drastic measures to protect his wealth from those who might claim it after his passing.

Lord Cranston hid his treasures throughout the mansion and the surrounding property, ensuring that his riches would not easily fall into the hands of others[^ref-2]. The game's manual describes the fantasy premise: Cranston Manor is presented as a place where the supernatural and the material world intersect[^ref-6]. Legend holds that the lord's spirit continues to patrol his domain, serving as an eternal guardian of his ill-gotten gains[^ref-2].

Players assume the role of an unnamed treasure hunter who has heard tales of the sixteen treasures concealed within Cranston Manor's walls and grounds[^ref-3]. The objective is straightforward yet challenging: locate and collect all sixteen treasures while navigating the dangers—both natural and supernatural—that await within the estate. The mansion itself becomes a character in the story, with its various rooms, hidden passages, and outdoor areas forming an elaborate puzzle box that the player must systematically explore and conquer[^ref-4].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Cranston Manor utilizes a text parser interface typical of early 1980s adventure games[^ref-4]. Players interact with the game world by typing commands using a two-word verb-noun structure[^ref-4]. According to the original documentation, "the computer has a tremendous vocabulary, although it only understands sentences of one or two words"[^ref-7]. This simple yet functional input method requires players to think carefully about how to describe their intended actions using basic command combinations like "GET LAMP" or "OPEN DOOR."

The game operates with keyboard-only input, with no mouse or joystick support[^ref-4]. Players navigate the environment using directional commands and examine objects to gather clues about the treasures' locations. The interface supports saving progress, with save game slots designated from A to O, providing players with fifteen save positions to record their progress through the adventure[^ref-7].

### Structure and Progression

The game follows a non-linear exploration structure where players are free to investigate different areas of Cranston Manor and its grounds in their chosen order. The ultimate goal requires collecting all sixteen treasures scattered throughout the property[^ref-3]. Progress is measured by the number of treasures successfully retrieved and secured.

One distinctive feature allows players to switch between graphic and text modes during gameplay[^ref-5]. When graphics are displayed, the screen is split between the visual representation of the current location and the text area where descriptions and commands appear. The text display area is limited to four lines[^ref-7], requiring concise communication between the game and player.

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The puzzle design in Cranston Manor follows the treasure-hunt paradigm common to adventure games of the era[^ref-5]. Players must explore locations, collect useful items, and determine how to access areas where treasures are hidden. The game demands creative problem-solving, with the original documentation warning that completion "may take weeks"[^ref-7].

The treasure collection mechanic provides the game's central structure, with each of the sixteen treasures presenting its own set of challenges to acquire[^ref-3]. Some treasures may be protected by environmental hazards, locked behind barriers requiring specific items to bypass, or guarded by the supernatural presence that allegedly haunts the manor[^ref-2].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

As an early 1980s release for home computers, Cranston Manor emerged during a period when formal game review culture was still developing. The game was marketed as part of Sierra's Hi-Res Adventures series, which had established a reputation for quality adventure gaming on the Apple II platform[^ref-8].

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospectives have evaluated Cranston Manor within the context of Sierra's development as a company and the evolution of the adventure game genre. A MobyGames user review from 2011 provides insight into how the game holds up decades after its release, noting that "before they became famous for their King's Quest series, On-Line Systems (or Sierra On-Line, as they were called later) released a number of adventure games for the Apple ][" called Hi-Res Adventures[^ref-4].

The same review critiques the game's technical aspects, noting the lack of sound and the limitations of the two-word parser system[^ref-4]. However, the color graphics were considered impressive for the era, and the treasure-hunting gameplay provided a clear objective that gave players motivation to explore every corner of the manor.

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** 7.4/10[^ref-3]

## Development

### Origins

Cranston Manor was developed during a pivotal period for On-Line Systems. The company had already released several successful adventure titles, and the Hi-Res Adventures series was becoming a flagship product line. Roberta Williams, who had designed the first two Hi-Res Adventures (Mystery House and The Wizard and the Princess), was unavailable to work on Cranston Manor as she was presumably occupied with the massive undertaking of Hi-Res Adventure #5: Time Zone[^ref-2].

The game was based on an original text adventure called "The Cranston Manor Adventure"[^ref-3], which was adapted and enhanced with graphics for the Hi-Res Adventure series. This adaptation process allowed On-Line Systems to leverage existing game designs while adding the visual elements that distinguished their Hi-Res Adventures from purely text-based competitors.

### Production

Development of Cranston Manor fell to Harold DeWitz, who worked alongside Ken Williams to bring the game to completion[^ref-2]. The game was created using the Adventure Development Language (ADL), Sierra's proprietary system for developing adventure games[^ref-2]. This development environment would evolve over the years, eventually leading to the AGI and later SCI engines that powered Sierra's most famous titles.

The game was created in Coarsegold, California, the small town where On-Line Systems had established its headquarters[^ref-6]. This location directly influenced the game's setting, as Coarsegold serves as the fictional setting for the mansion itself[^ref-4].

### Technical Achievements

Cranston Manor showcased the capabilities of the Apple II's high-resolution graphics mode, displaying color images that helped players visualize the game world[^ref-4]. The ability to toggle between graphics and text-only modes demonstrated On-Line Systems' understanding of different player preferences and hardware capabilities[^ref-5].

The Adventure Development Language (ADL) engine allowed for a streamlined development process while maintaining the two-word parser system that had become standard for the series[^ref-2]. The engine handled text parsing, graphics display, inventory management, and the save/load functionality that allowed players to preserve their progress across multiple sessions.

The original release featured a black and white folder, which was later replaced by a color folder as the game continued to sell[^ref-2]. Additionally, Cranston Manor was re-released under the SierraVenture branding, which Sierra used for certain adventure titles during this period[^ref-2][^ref-7].

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- The game is set in Coarsegold, the same California town where On-Line Systems was headquartered, providing a local flavor to the adventure[^ref-4][^ref-2].
- Cranston Manor is officially numbered as Hi-Res Adventure #3, though it was actually the fourth game released in the series[^ref-3][^ref-2].
- This was the first Hi-Res Adventure developed without Roberta Williams' direct involvement, marking a transition point for the series[^ref-2].
- The Japanese versions were published by StarCraft, Inc. for multiple Japanese computer platforms[^ref-3].

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Cranston Manor contributed to the growing reputation of On-Line Systems as a premier developer of adventure games for home computers. The Hi-Res Adventures series helped establish the company's position in the market before the revolutionary King's Quest launched in 1984[^ref-4][^ref-1]. The game's release across multiple platforms, including Japanese ports for the FM-7, PC-88, and PC-98, demonstrated the international appeal of Sierra's adventure game formula[^ref-3].

### Collections

Cranston Manor has been included in various retrospective collections and archives dedicated to preserving early Sierra software. The game is part of the Stephen M. Cabrinety Collection in the History of Microcomputing at Stanford University, which documents the early history of personal computer gaming[^ref-10]. An original Sierra On-Line catalog featuring the Hi-Res Adventures series, including Cranston Manor, has been preserved at the Internet Archive[^ref-11].

### Modern Preservation

The game has been made playable on modern systems through the ScummVM project, which added support for Cranston Manor in version 2.0.0, released on January 8, 2018[^ref-12]. ScummVM "makes it possible to run classic point and click adventures on modern platforms by replacing the original games' binaries with native interpreters"[^ref-12], ensuring that Cranston Manor remains accessible to new generations of adventure game enthusiasts.

### Critical Perspective

Cranston Manor occupies an important but often overlooked position in Sierra's history. While it lacks the name recognition of later titles like King's Quest or Space Quest, the game represents a critical period in the company's development as adventure game creators. The decision to have Harold DeWitz and Ken Williams develop the title while Roberta Williams focused on the massive Time Zone project showed the company's growing capacity to handle multiple development efforts simultaneously[^ref-2].

The game's straightforward treasure-hunting premise and two-word parser system reflect the design conventions of early 1980s adventure gaming. While these elements may seem primitive by modern standards, they represent the state of the art for home computer entertainment at the time. The Hi-Res Adventures series as a whole helped establish conventions that would influence adventure game design for years to come, even as Sierra's own technology evolved dramatically with the introduction of AGI and later SCI engines[^ref-1][^ref-8].
