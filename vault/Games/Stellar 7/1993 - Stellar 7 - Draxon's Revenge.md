<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 30, 2026</small>

## Overview

Stellar 7: Draxon's Revenge is a 1993 first-person sci-fi tank simulation game developed and published by [[Dynamix]] for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer console.[^ref-1] Serving as both a sequel and a remake to the 1990 Stellar 7 remake, the game was designed to showcase the capabilities of the then-new 3DO system with polygon models, improved graphics, CG cinemas, and CD audio.[^ref-2] The game is the fourth entry in the Stellar 7 series, following the original 1983 release, the 1990 remake, and Nova 9: The Return of Gir Draxon (1991).[^ref-3]

The game distinguished itself through its fully narrated introduction, voiced by actor Michael Dorn, who was famous at the time for playing the Klingon crewman Worf on the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation.[^ref-1] Drawing inspiration from the classic arcade game Battlezone, Stellar 7: Draxon's Revenge puts players in command of the Raven, a futuristic super-tank equipped with powerful weaponry and an anti-gravity propulsion system, as they battle against the tyrannical overlord Gir Draxon and his Arcturan Empire across seven alien worlds.[^ref-1]

The game featured significantly higher difficulty than earlier versions in the series, with only one life and no continues, making it a punishing experience for players seeking a challenge.[^ref-4] With texture-mapped polygonal graphics, 2D sprites for specific objects, and full CD sound and music including fully narrated cutscenes, Draxon's Revenge represented an ambitious attempt to bring the tank simulation genre to new hardware.[^ref-5]

## Story Summary

Set two thousand years in the future, Stellar 7: Draxon's Revenge places humanity in a desperate struggle against an ancient enemy.[^ref-2] Gir Draxon, the Overlord of the Arcturan Empire, has returned to enslave Earth and its inhabitants.[^ref-1] The Arcturans have discovered the warplinks, a revolutionary technology that allows users to transport instantaneously from one link to another, even across vast interstellar distances.[^ref-2]

With Earth's fleet halfway across the galaxy, the enemy has already reached the Sol system and occupied Saturn's moon Titan, leaving Mars' humanity virtually defenseless.[^ref-2] Draxon has returned with a mysterious Warplink capable of funneling his Death Cruisers from distant worlds, putting the certain destruction of Terran Command within reach.[^ref-7]

Humanity's only hope lies in a courageous pilot who must take control of the Raven, an experimental prototype heavy assault vehicle armed with powerful weapons and equipped with an anti-gravity device that allows it to move at incredible speeds.[^ref-2] The player must traverse seven alien worlds, each filled with eerie landscapes and hostile forces, ultimately confronting Draxon himself on Arcturas to save Earth from total annihilation.[^ref-4]

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Stellar 7: Draxon's Revenge is a first-person arcade-like tank simulation that places players directly in the cockpit of the Raven super-tank.[^ref-2] The Raven glides on an anti-gravity cushion, providing smooth and responsive movement across various alien terrains.[^ref-1] Controls are described as intuitive, with radar and energy indicators aiding survival throughout combat encounters.[^ref-1]

The tank's cockpit features a dashboard lined with buttons that activate various special powers and abilities.[^ref-8] Players navigate terrain using their handy radar display while tracking down alien craft and engaging in fast-paced combat.[^ref-8] Gauges on the right side of the screen indicate the amount of shields and power remaining, with the game ending when either resource runs out.[^ref-3]

### Structure and Progression

The game follows a level-based structure where players must complete a series of stages by defeating a number of enemy Arcturans and a Guardian boss to reveal the warplink that provides a gateway to the next world.[^ref-2] Each of the seven levels represents a different star system, matching the title's numerical designation.[^ref-3]

The game offers three difficulty levels to accommodate different player skill levels:[^ref-1]
- **Practice Mode:** Limited to the first world only
- **Standard Mode:** Full game with regular difficulty
- **Masochist Mode:** A punishing experience with significantly increased challenge

### Star Systems

The player travels through seven distinct worlds, each culminating in a showdown with a formidable Guardian boss:[^ref-1]
- Each world features unique eerie landscapes and hostile forces
- Defeating the Guardian boss unlocks a Warp Link to the next planet
- The final mission requires the destruction of Draxon's flagship to save Earth

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Combat involves navigating terrain and engaging in fast-paced battles with a variety of enemy craft, including some that are invisible or unidentified.[^ref-1] The player's tank is armed with lasers and upgradeable weapons, with the front-facing cannon having an unlimited supply of bullets that can fire up to two shots at a time.[^ref-3]

**Power-Ups and Special Abilities:**[^ref-1]
- **Super-Cannons:** Enhanced firepower for dealing with tougher enemies
- **Cloaking Device:** Renders the tank invisible to enemies for approximately one minute
- **Cloaking Detection:** Allows detection of enemies with cloaking devices
- **RC Bombs:** Remote-controlled explosives for tactical advantage
- **Ramming Ability:** Allows the player to physically collide with enemies
- **Mines:** Deployable defensive weapons

Power modules can be installed to increase efficiency, and the tank starts with enough power to cloak twice, with power slowly trickling away as time passes.[^ref-3] Enemy tanks and turrets have the same firepower as the player, requiring the use of terrain and strafing tactics to survive.[^ref-5]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Stellar 7: Draxon's Revenge received mixed reviews upon release, with critics acknowledging its technical achievements while noting gameplay shortcomings. Entertainment Weekly gave the game a C- rating in their January 14, 1994 review, which was part of a larger assessment of the new 3DO console's launch library.[^ref-9] The review was published alongside coverage of other 3DO titles as critics evaluated whether the $699 CD device would become "the entertainment standard of the future—or just an expensive blip on the time line of faddish consumer electronics."[^ref-9]

Edge magazine awarded the game a score of 5 out of 10, reflecting the lukewarm critical reception.[^ref-1] Critics noted that while Draxon's graphics were commendable with clean visuals and an exceptionally smooth frame-rate, the game was "saddled with a ridiculous name that makes people not want to play it."[^ref-8]

One reviewer compared the experience to "Battlezone updated for the 90's," praising the ability to pilot a floating tank on colorful distant planets while blasting any polygons that move.[^ref-8] However, disappointment was expressed at the special powers, which were expected to elevate the game "to the next level" but instead felt underwhelming—the reviewer noted that "even the 'super cannon' is only a marginal improvement" and that the radar view had "a refreshing impression there is no at all inside" due to enemies appearing sparsely.[^ref-8]

### Modern Assessment

Modern assessments have been somewhat more favorable, with players appreciating the game's historical significance as an early 3DO title. The game holds a Moby Score of 6.9, ranking it at #16,494 of approximately 27,600 games on MobyGames.[^ref-5] It also ranks #65 among 3DO games on the review ranking.[^ref-5]

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** 6.9/10 (Moby Score), 68% critics average (7 reviews), 3.4/5 player average (1 rating)[^ref-10]
- **VGChartz Community:** 7.8/10[^ref-11]
- **GameFAQs User Rating:** "Great" (15 ratings), Difficulty: "Tough" (13 ratings), Length: "26 Hours" (9 estimates)[^ref-7]
- **LaunchBox:** 15 players collected[^ref-5]

## Development

### Origins

The original Stellar 7 was created by [[Damon Slye]] for the Apple II and Commodore 64 in 1983, drawing inspiration from the 1980s arcade game Battlezone.[^ref-3] The franchise expanded through multiple remakes and sequels: a 1990 remake for MS-DOS (later ported to Amiga in 1991 and Classic Mac OS in 1993), the prequel Arcticfox (1986), and Nova 9: The Return of Gir Draxon (1991).[^ref-3]

Draxon's Revenge was conceived as both a sequel and remake designed specifically to showcase the capabilities of the new 3DO Interactive Multiplayer system.[^ref-2] The 3DO technology, developed by The 3DO Company and backed financially by corporate giants including Time Warner, MCA, and AT&T, had been licensed to more than 500 software makers by the time of the game's release.[^ref-9]

### Production

Development was led by brothers Dariusz and Piotr Lukaszuk, who served as directors, producers, and lead programmers on the project.[^ref-2] The game was written by David Selle, while Mark Peasley served as lead artist and art director.[^ref-2] Christopher Stevens composed the music score and created sound effects for the game.[^ref-5]

The development team created polygon models, improved graphics, CG cinemas, and CD audio specifically designed to demonstrate what the 3DO hardware could achieve.[^ref-2] The game features enhanced texture-mapped polygonal graphics combined with 2D sprites for specific objects, along with full CD sound and music including the fully narrated cutscenes voiced by Michael Dorn.[^ref-5]

### Technical Achievements

The CD format allowed for full digitized voice including narration by Michael Dorn, as well as complete CD audio for both music and sound effects.[^ref-4] The cinematic presentation was enhanced through CG movies created by Peter Lewis and Mark Peasley.[^ref-5]

## Voice Cast

| Character | Voice Actor |
|-----------|-------------|
| Narrator | Michael Dorn[^ref-1] |
| Narrator | Sher Alltucker[^ref-12] |

Voice direction details are not documented in available research, though the casting of Michael Dorn—famous for his role as Worf on Star Trek: The Next Generation—was clearly intended to attract science fiction fans to the title.[^ref-1]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Stellar 7: Draxon's Revenge was released as part of the early wave of 3DO software, a period when the platform was attempting to establish itself against the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, Game Boy, and Game Gear.[^ref-9] The 3DO's high price point of $699 limited its market penetration, and Draxon's Revenge remained a niche title primarily known among 3DO enthusiasts.[^ref-9]

The game was published in North America by Dynamix (a division of Sierra On-Line) and in Japan by T&E Soft, where it was released on March 26, 1994 under the title "Stellar 7: Draxon no Gyakushuu" (ステラ7 ドラクソンの逆襲).[^ref-13][^ref-8]

### Collections

Stellar 7: Draxon's Revenge has not been included in any known compilation releases or digital storefronts. The game remains a 3DO exclusive and is currently sought after by collectors, with copies listed on retro gaming sites for around $69.99 CAD.[^ref-14] The game appears on the GOG Dreamlist, indicating community interest in a digital re-release, with 77 votes supporting its addition to the platform.[^ref-15]

### Fan Projects

No significant fan projects, remakes, or mods have been documented for Stellar 7: Draxon's Revenge, likely due to its exclusive release on the 3DO platform and the relative obscurity of that console.

### Related Publications

Documentation for Stellar 7: Draxon's Revenge includes a game manual that was included with retail copies.[^ref-6] The Sierra Chest maintains scans of the original packaging and content for archival purposes.[^ref-6]

### Critical Perspective

Stellar 7: Draxon's Revenge occupies an interesting position in gaming history as both a franchise continuation and a technological showcase for emerging hardware. While the Stellar 7 series itself was influential in establishing the sci-fi tank simulation genre—essentially serving as an evolution of the Battlezone formula—Draxon's Revenge arrived at an awkward moment in gaming history when the 3DO was struggling to find its audience against established competitors.[^ref-9]

The game's design choices, including the significantly higher difficulty with only one life and no continues, represented an interesting departure from the more forgiving approach of earlier versions.[^ref-4] While this increased challenge appealed to hardcore players, it may have limited the game's accessibility to casual audiences. The celebrity voice casting of Michael Dorn demonstrated Dynamix's ambition to elevate the production values of the title, though reviews suggest the gameplay itself didn't quite match these lofty aspirations.[^ref-8] As a historical artifact, Draxon's Revenge remains a fascinating example of early 3DO development and the challenges of creating compelling software for new console hardware.
