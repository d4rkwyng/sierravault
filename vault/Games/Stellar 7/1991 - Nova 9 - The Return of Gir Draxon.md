# Nova 9: Return of Gir Draxon

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 30, 2026</small>

## Overview

Nova 9: Return of Gir Draxon is a futuristic tank combat game developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra On-Line in 1991[^ref-1]. As the sequel to Stellar 7, the game continues the story of Captain John Alex's battle against the villainous Gir Draxon, an interstellar tyrant seeking to rebuild his shattered empire[^ref-2]. The game was marketed with the bold tagline "Dynamix has just redefined state-of-the-art" and promised players action across nine visually distinct worlds[^ref-3].

Built using Dynamix's 3-Space engine, Nova 9 featured impressive polygon graphics for its time and represented part of Sierra's broader strategy to diversify beyond adventure games into action genres[^ref-4][^ref-5]. The game expanded on its predecessor's formula with enhanced graphics, new gameplay mechanics, and a darker narrative that dealt with personal loss and vengeance.

Computer Gaming World praised the game as "an excellent offering for arcade fans everywhere... a thoroughly professional effort"[^ref-4], while Dragon magazine awarded it 4.5 out of 5 stars in April 1992[^ref-4]. However, the game's notorious difficulty and controversial shift toward puzzle-heavy gameplay divided players, with some finding the challenge exhilarating and others frustrated by the steep learning curve.

## Story Summary

The game takes place two years after the devastating events of Stellar 7. The evil overlord Gir Draxon has made his return to rebuild his interstellar empire[^ref-1], and the stakes have never been more personal for Captain John Alex. During the previous war, Alex's wife Sarah was killed[^ref-11], leaving him driven by both duty and a desire for vengeance against the tyrant who destroyed his life.

When a distress call is issued from the unexplored Nova 9 system, Alex takes command of the experimental Raven II tank to investigate[^ref-2]. This new vehicle is equipped with advanced weaponry and a cloaking device that gives it capabilities beyond its predecessor. The mission leads him across nine different star systems in pursuit of Draxon, who awaits in the remote Nova 9 system[^ref-12].

As the Archive.org description summarizes: "It has been two years since the Stellar 7 war. Gir Draxon, the villain, has not been found. Nova 9 has just issued a distress call... Captain John Alex, takes the experimental Raven II tank to investigate the distress call..."[^ref-2].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Nova 9 features first-person tank combat with multiple viewing perspectives available to players[^ref-14]. The game can be controlled using the numeric keypad, arrow keys, or joystick, providing flexibility for different player preferences[^ref-10]. Players have access to various camera angles to better navigate the battlefield:

- Cockpit view (first-person)
- Outside rear view
- Outside front view
- Side views

This variety of perspectives allowed players to choose their preferred viewpoint for combat situations, though most experienced players preferred the cockpit view for precision aiming.

### The Raven II Tank

The Raven II represents a significant upgrade from the original Stellar 7 vehicle. Its arsenal includes:

- Standard cannons for basic combat
- Special weapons collected as power-ups
- A cloaking device for tactical stealth

The game features an arcade-styled power-up system that allows players to store up to nine power-ups[^ref-4]. However, damage can potentially break power-up slots, adding a strategic element to combat where players must balance aggressive play against the risk of losing their accumulated advantages.

### Structure and Progression

The game is structured around exploration of nine planets, each with distinct visual characteristics and enemy types[^ref-15]. Unlike its predecessor, Nova 9 incorporates significant puzzle-solving elements alongside the traditional tank combat, a design decision that proved controversial among players[^ref-16].

The planet environments range from barren wastelands to technologically advanced enemy installations. Each world presents unique challenges, enemy configurations, and environmental hazards that require players to adapt their strategies.

### Difficulty and Save System

Notably, the game includes no save feature, requiring players to complete it in single sessions[^ref-10]. Combined with the game's extreme difficulty, this design choice proved polarizing. One MobyGames reviewer stated the game was "Hard as a frickin' rock" and compared its difficulty level to Shadow of the Beast—one of the most notoriously difficult games of the era[^ref-17].

The lack of saves meant that a single mistake in the later levels could cost players hours of progress, leading to significant frustration but also genuine accomplishment for those who persevered.

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The game's shift toward puzzle-solving mechanics was criticized by some reviewers who felt it broke up the action rhythm and had little connection to the plot[^ref-16]. One reviewer asked pointedly: "What's with all the puzzles? This is a tank, not Mario and Luigi!"[^ref-7]. These puzzles required players to navigate through maze-like environments and solve environmental challenges beyond simple combat.

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Dragon | 4.5/5 | Positive review from April 1992[^ref-4] |
| Amiga Games | 83% | October 1992 review by Kult Boy[^ref-18] |
| Datormagazin | 87% | November 1992 review by Göran Fröjdh[^ref-18] |
| Amiga Mania | 77% | November 1992 review by Tony Jones[^ref-18] |
| Amiga Joker | 68% | October 1992 review by Max Magenauer[^ref-18] |
| The One Amiga | 59% | October 1992 review by Simon Byron[^ref-18] |
| Computer Gaming World | Positive | "An excellent offering for arcade fans everywhere"[^ref-4] |

The range of scores—from 59% to 87%—reflects the game's divisive nature. European reviewers, particularly in Sweden (Datormagazin) and Germany (Amiga Games), responded more favorably than British critics (The One Amiga).

### Critical Analysis

Computer Gaming World praised the game as "an excellent offering for arcade fans everywhere... a thoroughly professional effort"[^ref-4]. This endorsement emphasized the technical quality and appeal to action game enthusiasts.

However, critics were divided on the puzzle elements. Those seeking pure arcade action found the puzzles intrusive, while others appreciated the additional depth they provided. The extreme difficulty was consistently noted, with reviewers warning that casual players might find the experience frustrating.

### Modern Assessment

Modern reviews have been mixed, with players frequently citing the game's extreme difficulty as both its greatest strength and weakness:

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Abandonware DOS | 4.18/5 | Modern user rating[^ref-15] |
| MyAbandonware | 4.33/5 | User rating[^ref-14] |
| MobyGames | 75% | Aggregate user rating[^ref-7] |
| Glitchwave | 2.50/5.0 | Modern assessment[^ref-20] |

Some players appreciated the technical presentation, with one noting that "both the music (Roland/LAPC-1) and graphics were incredible at the time"[^ref-7]. The game's pseudo-3D graphics were impressive for early 1990s standards[^ref-4], though they have not aged as gracefully as some contemporary titles.

Abandonware DOS humorously summarized the experience: "If you ever wanted to pilot a hovering tank while yelling at a computer screen, Nova 9 has you covered"[^ref-15].

## Development

### Origins

Nova 9 was developed during Dynamix's productive period under Sierra On-Line, when the company was creating both adventure and simulator games[^ref-5]. The game emerged as a direct sequel to Stellar 7 (originally a 1983 game, remade by Dynamix in 1990), continuing that game's story and characters while attempting to expand the gameplay formula[^ref-21].

The development team sought to modernize the Stellar 7 experience with enhanced graphics and deeper gameplay mechanics. The addition of puzzle elements represented an attempt to differentiate the sequel from simple arcade-style action.

### Production Team

The development team included:

**Designers:**
- David Selle (Lead Designer)
- Paul Bowman

**Technical Staff:**
- Damon Slye (3-Space engine development)
- Multiple programmers and artists from Dynamix's Eugene, Oregon studio

**Composers:**
- Christopher Stevens
- Dale Cooper

The music was considered one of the game's highlights, with the Roland/LAPC-1 soundtrack earning particular praise from players with compatible sound hardware[^ref-8][^ref-7].

### Technical Implementation

The game was built using Dynamix's 3-Space engine, which enabled the impressive polygon graphics that were considered state-of-the-art for the time period[^ref-4]. The engine had been developed for Dynamix's flight simulators and proved adaptable for ground-based vehicular combat.

The game was distributed on multiple floppy disk formats:
- 4x 5.25" disks
- 6x 3.5" disks

This distribution format was typical for games of the era, allowing compatibility with both older disk drive formats and the increasingly popular 3.5" drives[^ref-10].

### Graphics and Audio

Nova 9 featured pseudo-3D graphics using filled polygon rendering[^ref-4]. The game supported EGA graphics mode as its primary display[^ref-10], though the Amiga version offered enhanced visuals taking advantage of that platform's capabilities.

The audio system supported Roland/LAPC-1 for enhanced sound, providing atmospheric music and sound effects that elevated the combat experience[^ref-10]. Players without Roland hardware still received PC speaker audio, but the difference in quality was significant.

## Legacy

### Critical Reputation

Nova 9's legacy is complicated by its difficulty and design choices. While the game featured impressive technical achievements for its time, the shift from pure action to puzzle-heavy gameplay alienated some fans of the original Stellar 7[^ref-16]. The lack of a save feature remains a point of criticism in retrospective assessments.

### Planned Sequel

Interestingly, evidence suggests there were tentative plans for another sequel called "Nova 9: The Revenge of Raf Torin," though it's unclear whether any actual development occurred on this project[^ref-22]. The Games That Weren't database documents this unreleased follow-up, suggesting Dynamix or Sierra considered continuing the franchise before other priorities intervened.

### Preservation and Accessibility

The game remains available through various abandonware preservation sites and continues to be discussed among retro gaming enthusiasts[^ref-14]. Its inclusion on preservation platforms ensures that players interested in early 1990s polygon graphics and vehicular combat can still experience the game.

### Stellar 7 Series Context

Nova 9 exists within the broader Stellar 7 franchise:

1. **Stellar 7** (1983) - Original version by Damon Slye
2. **Stellar 7** (1990) - Dynamix remake with enhanced graphics
3. **Nova 9: Return of Gir Draxon** (1991) - Direct sequel
4. **Stellar 7: Draxon's Revenge** (1993) - 3DO console version
5. **Nova 9: The Revenge of Raf Torin** (Unreleased) - Planned sequel

### Influence on Later Games

While Nova 9 wasn't commercially dominant, its combination of first-person vehicular combat with strategic elements influenced the development of similar games. The tank simulation genre would continue to evolve through titles like Spectre VR (1994) and later games that refined the formula Nova 9 helped establish.
