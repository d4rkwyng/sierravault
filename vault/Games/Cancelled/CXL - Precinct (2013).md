## Overview

Precinct was an ambitious crowdfunded police adventure video game announced in 2013 by [[Jim Walls]], the creator of Sierra On-Line's legendary Police Quest series[^ref-1]. Conceived as a spiritual successor to the classic franchise whose official name was owned by Activision, the project sought to revive the police procedural adventure genre for a new generation of players[^ref-2]. The game was designed to combine authentic police procedures with modern gaming technology, featuring first-person gameplay with intense action sequences including shootouts, high-speed car chases, investigations, foot pursuits, and hand-to-hand combat[^ref-2].

Set in the fictional corrupt town of Fraser Canyon, California, Precinct would have placed players in the role of Officer Maxwell Jones, starting as a rookie and progressing through the ranks while facing adrenaline-charged scenarios and conducting real police procedures[^ref-3]. The project launched on Kickstarter on July 16, 2013, but the campaign was ultimately cancelled by its creators in August 2013[^ref-1]. Rather than continuing to seek funding through the traditional Kickstarter model, the development team pivoted to a staged funding approach, intending to create a playable pilot version that would allow potential backers to experience the vision behind the game rather than relying solely on a tech demo video[^ref-1].

The cancellation of the Kickstarter campaign and subsequent attempts to fund the project through alternative means marked the end of one of the most anticipated Sierra alumni revivals of the early 2010s crowdfunding boom[^ref-4]. The project remains significant as a testament to the enduring appeal of the Police Quest legacy and the challenges faced by veteran designers attempting to revive classic franchises in the modern gaming landscape.

## Story Summary

Precinct was set in the fictional town of Fraser Canyon, California, a corrupt municipality plagued by crime and institutional decay[^ref-3]. Players would assume the role of Officer Maxwell Jones, a young police officer beginning his career in law enforcement and navigating the treacherous waters of a town where the line between law and lawlessness had become dangerously blurred[^ref-4].

The narrative was designed to follow Jones from his days as a rookie patrol officer through his advancement in the department, with each episode presenting new challenges and moral dilemmas[^ref-3]. The story would explore themes of corruption, justice, and the personal toll of police work, drawing heavily from Jim Walls' own experiences as a real-world law enforcement officer[^ref-4].

As with the original Police Quest games, the storyline was intended to present realistic police scenarios that would require players to follow proper procedures while solving crimes and apprehending perpetrators[^ref-3]. The episodic structure would have allowed for an evolving narrative that could respond to player choices and develop the protagonist's character over multiple installments[^ref-4].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Precinct was designed to utilize a first-person perspective, marking a significant departure from the earlier Police Quest games which employed third-person views[^ref-2]. The game was being developed in the Unity3D engine, allowing for real-time 3D environments that would bring Fraser Canyon to life with modern graphical fidelity[^ref-4].

The gameplay was conceived as an adventure game with substantial action sequences, blending the investigative and procedural elements that defined Police Quest with more dynamic gameplay mechanics suitable for contemporary audiences[^ref-2]. Players would interact with the environment, interview witnesses and suspects, collect evidence, and engage in various action scenarios.

### Structure and Progression

The game was planned as an episodic series, with each installment representing a new chapter in Officer Maxwell Jones' career[^ref-4]. The structure would mirror a television police drama, with self-contained cases that also contributed to an overarching narrative about corruption in Fraser Canyon.

The crowdfunding campaign outlined a staged development approach with the following milestones[^ref-3]:

- **Proof of Concept ($25,000):** Initial demonstration of core gameplay mechanics
- **Vertical Slice ($90,000):** A representative playable section showcasing the full game experience
- **Game Demo ($250,000):** A substantial playable demo for public release
- **Full Game ($400,000):** Complete development of the first episode

### Puzzles and Mechanics

True to its Police Quest heritage, Precinct was designed to require players to follow correct police procedure throughout their investigations[^ref-2]. This meant that improper handling of evidence, failure to read Miranda rights, or violations of protocol could result in cases being thrown out or other negative consequences.

The game would feature intense fast action gameplay sequences integrated with the adventure elements[^ref-2]. These included:

- Shootouts requiring tactical decision-making
- High-speed car chases through Fraser Canyon
- Detailed crime scene investigations
- Foot pursuits of fleeing suspects
- Hand-to-hand combat encounters
- Interview and interrogation sequences

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

As Precinct was never released, there are no reviews of a finished product. However, the announcement and subsequent Kickstarter campaign generated significant coverage in gaming media:

**Kotaku** reported on the project with enthusiasm in July 2013, with journalist Luke Plunkett noting that "Police Quest is basically back" when the Kickstarter launched[^ref-2]. The coverage highlighted Jim Walls' credentials as the creator of the original Police Quest series.

**Kicktraq** tracked the campaign progress and documented its ultimate cancellation by the creators in August 2013[^ref-1]. The site's analytics showed the funding momentum that built during the initial campaign period before the team decided to pivot strategies.

**Sierra Classic Gaming** provided detailed coverage of the project, documenting the funding tiers and staged development approach[^ref-3]. Their comprehensive game listing served as a primary source for campaign details.

**Larry Laffer Net** covered the project with a focus on Sierra alumni connections, featuring Al Lowe's endorsement and detailed information about the development team at Tiny Castle Studios[^ref-4].

The gaming press recognized the historical significance of Jim Walls' return to the genre he helped define. Publications covered the campaign's launch, its cancellation, and the subsequent pivot to a staged funding model[^ref-1]. The project was positioned within the broader context of the early 2010s crowdfunding boom that saw numerous Sierra alumni attempting to revive classic adventure gaming franchises.

### Modern Assessment

Precinct remains a notable example of a cancelled crowdfunding project from the adventure game revival era. The game is documented on **Sierra Classic Gaming** as an unreleased title from a legendary designer[^ref-3]. The project's failure to secure funding demonstrated the challenges of reviving classic franchises even with original creators attached.

The cancelled project is sometimes discussed in retrospectives about the Police Quest series and the broader adventure game crowdfunding movement that began with Double Fine Adventure (Broken Age) and the Two Guys from Andromeda's SpaceVenture[^ref-4]. **Wikipedia** now documents "The Precinct" (2025), an unrelated game by Fallen Tree Games that received mixed reviews (61% on Metacritic, 6.1/10 user score), though this is a completely separate project[^ref-5].

**Campaign Statistics:**
- **Platform:** Kickstarter[^ref-1]
- **Campaign Duration:** July 16 - August 6, 2013[^ref-8]
- **Funding Goal:** $500,000[^ref-8]
- **Amount Pledged:** $85,756 (17.2% of goal)[^ref-8]
- **Backers:** 1,870[^ref-8]
- **Result:** Cancelled by creator[^ref-1][^ref-8]
- **Funding Model:** Staged development with milestone-based backing[^ref-3]

## Development

### Origins

Precinct emerged from Jim Walls' desire to return to the police adventure genre he had pioneered at Sierra On-Line[^ref-2]. As a former California Highway Patrol officer who left the force in 1984 following a violent shootout, Walls had brought an unprecedented level of authenticity to the original Police Quest series[^ref-4]. However, with the Police Quest name owned by Activision following Sierra's acquisition, a spiritual successor under a new title was the only viable path forward[^ref-2].

The project was developed under the banner of Jim Walls Reloaded, in partnership with development studio Tiny Castle Studios[^ref-1][^ref-4]. The timing coincided with a renaissance in adventure gaming crowdfunding, with successful campaigns for projects like Broken Age and Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded demonstrating that there was an audience willing to fund revivals of classic Sierra franchises.

Al Lowe, creator of Leisure Suit Larry and a programmer on the original Police Quest, endorsed the project, noting: "If you've played Police Quest, you know exactly what Jim Walls is like, because that game is Jim Walls"[^ref-4].

### Production

The development team began working with Unity3D to create a modern first-person adventure game that would honor the legacy of Police Quest while appealing to contemporary players[^ref-4]. The game was planned for release on multiple platforms, including PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, PS4, and Xbox Live Arcade[^ref-1].

The Kickstarter campaign launched on July 16, 2013, seeking funding to develop the game in stages[^ref-1]. However, the campaign encountered difficulties in reaching its goals. In August 2013, the creators made the decision to cancel the Kickstarter campaign and pivot to an alternative funding model[^ref-1].

Robert Lindsley, president of Jim Walls Reloaded, explained the reasoning behind the cancellation: the team wanted to "allow potential backers to 'experience' the vision behind the spiritual successor, rather than use a tech demo video to decide whether the game was worthy of backing"[^ref-1]. This led to the development of a staged funding approach where backers could contribute to reach specific development milestones.

**Development Credits:**[^ref-1][^ref-4][^ref-8]
- **Creator/Designer:** Jim Walls
- **Executive Producer:** Robert Lindsley (former Sierra/Microsoft Games/Harmonix, 80+ games shipped)
- **Art Director:** Scott Butler (former Argonaut/Sony, 50+ games shipped)
- **Production Director:** Jason Crawford (Tiny Castle Studios founder)
- **Production Company:** Jim Walls Reloaded
- **Development Studio:** Tiny Castle Studios (Glendale, CA)
- **Engine:** Unity3D

### Technical Achievements

The game was designed to leverage the Unity3D engine to create real-time 3D environments representing the fictional town of Fraser Canyon[^ref-4]. The first-person perspective represented a significant technical evolution from the earlier Police Quest games, allowing for more immersive investigation sequences and action gameplay.

The planned distribution model included digital download via Steam, representing the shift in game distribution that had occurred since the original Police Quest era[^ref-4].

### Technical Specifications

**Planned Specifications:**[^ref-4]
- **Perspective:** First-person 3D
- **Engine:** Unity3D
- **Graphics:** Real-time 3D environments
- **Distribution:** Digital download via Steam

### Cut Content

As the game was never completed, the entire project effectively represents cut content. The planned episodic structure would have included multiple installments following Maxwell Jones' career progression[^ref-4]. The original five-game series concept mentioned in early coverage suggests ambitious plans that were never realized[^ref-2].

### Version History

| Version | Date | Platform | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| Kickstarter Campaign | July 16, 2013 | N/A | Campaign launched[^ref-1] |
| Campaign Cancelled | August 2013 | N/A | Pivoted to staged funding[^ref-1] |
| Staged Funding | September 2013 | N/A | Alternative funding model announced[^ref-3] |

### Technical Issues

The project never reached a state where technical issues in gameplay could be documented. The primary issues were financial and organizational rather than technical, with the Kickstarter campaign failing to generate sufficient momentum before being cancelled[^ref-1].

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- Jim Walls was a California Highway Patrol officer who left the force in 1984 after being involved in a violent shootout, an experience that directly influenced the authenticity of his game designs[^ref-4]
- The Police Quest name was owned by Activision, necessitating the creation of a spiritual successor under a new title[^ref-2]
- The project was part of a broader wave of Sierra alumni attempting to revive classic adventure franchises through crowdfunding in the early 2010s[^ref-2]
- Al Lowe, who programmed the original Police Quest, provided an endorsement for the project[^ref-4]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Precinct generated no sales as it was never completed or released. The cancelled Kickstarter campaign and subsequent staged funding attempt failed to produce a finished product[^ref-1]. The project remains significant primarily as a historical footnote in the attempted revival of classic Sierra adventure gaming.

### Collections

Precinct was never released and therefore does not appear in any game collections or compilations.

### Fan Projects

No significant fan projects have emerged to complete or recreate Precinct. The intellectual property status of the cancelled project remains unclear, potentially complicating any community efforts to revive the concept.

### Related Publications

No official hint books, strategy guides, or novelizations were published for Precinct, as the game was never completed.

### Critical Perspective

Precinct represents a poignant chapter in the history of adventure gaming revivals. The early 2010s saw numerous Sierra alumni attempting to recapture past glories through crowdfunding, with varying degrees of success. While projects like Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded and Gabriel Knight 20th Anniversary Edition reached completion, others like Precinct demonstrated that nostalgia and pedigree alone could not guarantee successful funding[^ref-1][^ref-2].

The project's failure highlighted several challenges facing veteran designers in the crowdfunding era: the need to demonstrate tangible progress rather than relying on reputation, the difficulty of communicating a vision for a game that didn't yet exist, and the competitive landscape of crowdfunding where multiple projects competed for the same nostalgic audience[^ref-1]. Jim Walls' authentic law enforcement background, which had been such an asset in the original Police Quest development, proved insufficient to overcome these modern fundraising challenges.

The Police Quest legacy would continue to influence gaming, however. The concept of playing as a law enforcement officer following proper procedures has been explored by numerous subsequent games, even if Precinct itself was never completed[^ref-2].

## Series Continuity

While Precinct was not officially part of the Police Quest series due to trademark issues, it was conceived as a spiritual successor that would continue the legacy Jim Walls established at Sierra On-Line[^ref-2]. The game would have represented Walls' return to the police procedural adventure genre he pioneered, updating the concept for modern gaming platforms and audiences.

The Police Quest series proper concluded with Police Quest: SWAT (1995) and continued in a different direction with the SWAT tactical shooter series. Precinct was intended to return to the adventure game roots of the franchise, emphasizing investigation and procedure over tactical action[^ref-4].

- **Previous:** [[1991 - Police Quest III - The Kindred]] (Last Jim Walls Police Quest game)
- **Spiritual Connection:** Police Quest series ([[Sierra On-Line]], 1987-1993)

## Note on "The Precinct" (2025)

Research for this article also uncovered information about an unrelated game titled "The Precinct," developed by Fallen Tree Games and published by Kwalee, scheduled for release on May 13, 2025[^ref-5][^ref-6][^ref-7]. This is a separate project from Jim Walls' Precinct and is an action sandbox police game set in the fictional city of Averno in 1983[^ref-5]. The 2025 game features Officer Nick Cordell Jr. and has been described as "a love letter to classic cop movies"[^ref-6]. Despite the similar name and police theme, these are distinct projects with no connection to each other or to Sierra's Police Quest series.
