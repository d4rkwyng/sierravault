## Overview

Hoyle Backgammon & Cribbage is a digital adaptation of two classic board and card games released by [[Sierra On-Line]] in 1999 for Windows and Macintosh platforms.[^ref-1][^ref-2] The game was part of Sierra's long-running Hoyle series, which had been bringing traditional games to home computers since 1989.[^ref-3] Named after 18th century playing card expert Edmond Hoyle, the series was renowned for its accessible yet faithful recreations of beloved tabletop games.[^ref-3]

The title combined two distinct games: backgammon, the ancient race game where players move markers around the board attempting to bear off all their pieces first, and cribbage, a classic card game involving strategic card play and a distinctive scoring board.[^ref-1] Players could challenge ten different computer-controlled opponents of varying skill levels or compete against friends via internet play, a feature that was becoming increasingly common in late 1990s gaming.[^ref-1]

Released during a turbulent period in Sierra's corporate history—just months after the February 1999 "Black Monday" layoffs that saw approximately 135 employees lose their jobs—Hoyle Backgammon & Cribbage represented the company's continued commitment to their casual gaming catalog even as their adventure game division faced significant restructuring.[^ref-4] The game received an ESRB rating of Everyone, making it suitable for players of all ages.[^ref-1]

## Story Summary

As a digital adaptation of classic board and card games, Hoyle Backgammon & Cribbage does not feature a traditional narrative story. Instead, the game focuses on providing authentic recreations of both backgammon and cribbage with computer opponents and multiplayer functionality.[^ref-1]

In backgammon, players engage in the time-honored race game where the objective is to move all fifteen of their markers around the board and off before their opponent can do the same.[^ref-1] The game incorporates all traditional backgammon rules including the doubling cube, hitting and entering from the bar, and bearing off procedures.

Cribbage, the other half of this package, involves players using a standard deck of cards in combination with a traditional cribbage board for scoring.[^ref-1] Players form combinations of cards to accumulate points, "leapfrogging" their pegs around the board toward the finish line in a race to 121 points.[^ref-1] The game includes all standard cribbage conventions including the crib, pegging, and go situations.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Hoyle Backgammon & Cribbage utilized a point-and-click interface controlled via keyboard and mouse.[^ref-1] The game presented both backgammon and cribbage through intuitive graphical interfaces that faithfully represented their physical counterparts while taking advantage of computer automation for scoring and rule enforcement.

### Structure and Progression

The game offered two distinct gaming experiences packaged together:

- **Backgammon:** Complete implementation of the classic race game with computer opponents of varying difficulty levels[^ref-1]
- **Cribbage:** Full cribbage experience including the board, dealing, pegging, and scoring phases[^ref-1]

Players could compete against ten different computer-controlled opponents, each presumably offering different playing styles and skill levels.[^ref-1] For those seeking human competition, the game supported internet multiplayer, allowing friends to compete remotely.[^ref-1]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Rather than traditional puzzles, Hoyle Backgammon & Cribbage focused on strategic gameplay mechanics inherent to both featured games.

In backgammon, players faced strategic decisions regarding:[^ref-1]
- Movement of checkers based on dice rolls
- When to hit opponent's blots
- Timing of bearing off
- Use of the doubling cube

Cribbage gameplay required mastery of:[^ref-1]
- Card selection for the crib
- Optimal play order during pegging
- Recognition of scoring combinations (fifteens, pairs, runs, flushes)
- Strategic go decisions

## Development

### Origins

Hoyle Backgammon & Cribbage emerged from Sierra's successful Hoyle series, which had been producing digital versions of classic games since the first volume in 1989.[^ref-3] The series was named after Edmond Hoyle, the 18th century author whose books on card games established standardized rules still referenced today.[^ref-3] By 1999, the Hoyle brand had expanded to cover various card games, board games, puzzles, dice games, and casino simulations.[^ref-3]

### Production

The game was developed internally at Sierra On-Line, Inc. during a challenging period for the company.[^ref-4] Following CUC International's acquisition of Sierra in July 1996 and subsequent merger with HFC Incorporated to form Cendant Corporation in December 1997, the company faced significant corporate upheaval.[^ref-4] The 1998 financial scandal involving Cendant's leadership caused stock prices to plummet from $39 to $20 per share, leading to substantial financial losses and restructuring.[^ref-4]

The development team completed the project despite these corporate challenges, releasing the game in early 1999.[^ref-6] The game featured voice work recorded by Pat Cashman and an original score by composer Evan Schiller.[^ref-1]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Hoyle Backgammon & Cribbage was released during a tumultuous period in Sierra Entertainment's history. The game arrived just months after the February 22, 1999 "Black Monday" layoffs, which saw the closure of multiple Sierra development studios and approximately 135 employees losing their jobs.[^ref-4] Despite these challenges, Sierra continued to support their casual gaming catalog, with the Hoyle series remaining a consistent part of their lineup.

### Collections

The game was part of the broader Hoyle franchise, which Sierra Entertainment developed and published from 1989 through 2003.[^ref-3] The series continued under Encore, Inc. from 2005 to 2016, eventually leading to Encore's own Classic Games series beginning in 2020.[^ref-3]

### Fan Projects

### Related Publications

### Critical Perspective

Hoyle Backgammon & Cribbage represents a specific moment in Sierra Entertainment's history—the late 1990s period when the company was transitioning from an independent developer and publisher into a subsidiary of larger corporate entities.[^ref-7] The game exemplifies Sierra's strategy of maintaining their casual gaming catalog even as their more prominent adventure game divisions faced restructuring.

The Hoyle series as a whole had a significant impact on the digital adaptation of traditional games, bringing classic card and board games to personal computers at a time when such entertainment options were limited.[^ref-3] While individual titles like Hoyle Backgammon & Cribbage may not have achieved the cultural impact of Sierra's adventure games, they provided consistent revenue and introduced countless players to traditional games in digital form.

The game also serves as a historical artifact of late 1990s gaming, representing the era's approach to casual games before the mobile gaming revolution would transform the landscape entirely. Its inclusion of internet multiplayer functionality demonstrates Sierra's awareness of emerging online gaming trends.[^ref-1]
