## Overview

Hoyle Kids Games 2000 is a compilation of classic children's games released by [[Sierra On-Line]] in September 2000 as part of their long-running Hoyle game series.[^ref-1][^ref-2] The title brought Sierra's familiar format of colorful graphics and internet play to a younger audience, featuring twelve fun titles including Battling Ships, Checkers, Chinese Checkers, Snakes & Ladders, Crazy Eights, Go Fish, Memory Match, Old Maid, War, Hangman, Placer Racer, and Speedy Racer.[^ref-1] Additionally, two bonus games—The Music Game (similar to Simon) and Tic Tac Toe—could be unlocked by players.[^ref-1]

The game was designed to appeal to families and younger players, supporting both single-player experiences against animated computer opponents and multiplayer sessions with up to four players locally or online.[^ref-1] A standout feature was the Facemaker utility, which allowed players to customize their own character avatars, adding a personal touch to the gaming experience.[^ref-1] An animated talking Genie served as the in-game helper, explaining rules and providing assistance to players who needed guidance.[^ref-1]

Released during Sierra's transition period under Havas Interactive ownership, Hoyle Kids Games 2000 represented an effort to expand the Hoyle brand beyond its traditional adult casino and card game audience.[^ref-3] The game was featured prominently in Sierra's 2000-2001 product catalog on page 19, indicating it was considered an important part of their family-friendly lineup.[^ref-4]

## Story Summary

As a compilation of classic board and card games, Hoyle Kids Games 2000 does not feature a traditional narrative storyline. Instead, the game presents a collection of timeless children's games within a colorful, animated framework.[^ref-1] Players engage with various computer-controlled opponents who have distinct personalities and backstories that add character to the gaming experience.

Among the memorable computer opponents is Marvin, a T-Rex character described as "quite likable" despite being a fierce dinosaur.[^ref-6] According to the character's biography, Marvin is "self-conscious about his tiny arms and still bitter about the Ice Age" but has notably "not eaten an opponent yet."[^ref-6] Another distinctive character is Roswell, described as "the sole survivor of the infamous 'crash' in Roswell, New Mexico," who was subsequently "employed by the government as a janitor at Area 51 to keep this event hidden from the public."[^ref-6]

Captain Scurvy, a pirate character, also appears in the game and notably shares some voice lines with Captain Barnes from the earlier Hoyle Classic Games (1995), suggesting character continuity within the Hoyle universe.[^ref-6] These colorful personalities transformed simple games like Go Fish and Checkers into more engaging experiences for young players.

Hoyle Kids Games 2000 emerged from Sierra On-Line's strategy to expand their successful Hoyle brand into the children's market.[^ref-3] The Hoyle series had been producing quality card and casino games since 1989, and by 2000, the company recognized an opportunity to create family-friendly content using the established brand recognition.[^ref-3] The game was developed as Sierra On-Line transitioned through various corporate ownerships, ultimately being distributed under the Sierra Entertainment banner.[^ref-2]

Jeff Hoyt served as Script Writer for the project, contributing to the character dialogues and in-game text that brought the animated opponents to life.[^ref-9] Hoyt's involvement with the Hoyle series extended from 1997 to 2011, making him a significant contributor to the brand's voice and personality.[^ref-9]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Hoyle Kids Games 2000 was featured in Sierra's 2000-2001 product catalog on page 19, indicating it was considered an important part of their family product lineup.[^ref-4] The game was released during a transitional period for Sierra under various corporate ownerships, and represented an effort to diversify the Hoyle brand's appeal beyond adult gamers.[^ref-3]

### Collections

The game was marketed as a standalone product and was part of the broader Hoyle series of game compilations that Sierra produced throughout the 1990s and 2000s.[^ref-5] It sits alongside other Hoyle titles in Sierra's extensive catalog of board and card game collections.[^ref-5]

### Critical Perspective

Hoyle Kids Games 2000 represents Sierra On-Line's attempt to leverage their established Hoyle brand for the children's market. While Sierra was primarily known for adventure games and adult-oriented card game collections, this title demonstrated the company's recognition that family-friendly gaming was a viable market segment. The inclusion of internet multiplayer in a children's game was forward-thinking for 2000, anticipating the social gaming trends that would become dominant in later years.

The game's emphasis on character personality through opponents like Marvin the T-Rex and Roswell the alien shows Sierra's understanding that even simple games benefit from distinctive presentation. The Facemaker avatar system presaged the customization features that would become standard in children's games and later in social platforms. While not as historically significant as Sierra's adventure game titles, Hoyle Kids Games 2000 serves as an interesting artifact of the company's diversification efforts during a period of corporate transition.
