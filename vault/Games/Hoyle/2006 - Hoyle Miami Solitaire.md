## Overview

Hoyle Miami Solitaire is a card game compilation released in November 2006 for PC, developed and published by Encore Software under the storied Hoyle brand name [^ref-1][^ref-2][^ref-12][^ref-16]. The game represents a thematic departure for the long-running Hoyle series, transporting players to the vibrant Art Deco era of 1920s Miami, where classic solitaire gameplay meets the glamorous aesthetic of the Jazz Age [^ref-3]. The title was also released in European markets under the alternate name "Hoyle South Beach Solitaire" [^ref-1].

Featuring over 55 different solitaire variations, the game distinguishes itself from other entries in the Hoyle catalog through its story-driven approach and mansion-building meta-game [^ref-3][^ref-5]. Players are hosted by the character John Carlisle Dunsworthy as they work through tournament play across 100 levels, unlocking card backs, bonus games, and decorative items for their Key Biscayne mansion [^ref-5][^ref-5]. The fusion of classic card gaming with Miami's Latin-influenced style and Art Deco visual design creates what reviewers described as "a vibrant fusion of classic solitaire gameplay with a colorful Miami twist" [^ref-6].

As part of the broader Hoyle franchise—a name traditionally associated with Sierra Entertainment in the gaming sphere—Hoyle Miami Solitaire continues the brand's legacy of delivering officially branded card game experiences to casual gaming audiences [^ref-7][^ref-13][^ref-17]. The game was distributed through various channels including retail and digital download platforms such as Big Fish Games [^ref-6][^ref-14][^ref-15].

## Story Summary

Hoyle Miami Solitaire is set during Miami's Jazz Age of the 1920s, embracing the city's vibrant Art Deco architecture and Latin cultural influences as its thematic backdrop [^ref-3][^ref-5]. The game's marketing prominently featured its "exciting 1920's storyline" as a key selling point, differentiating it from more conventional solitaire compilations [^ref-3].

Players are welcomed into the game world by John Carlisle Dunsworthy, a character who serves as the host and guide throughout the experience [^ref-5]. While the narrative framing is relatively light compared to traditional adventure games, the story mode provides context and motivation for progressing through the various solitaire challenges.

The ultimate goal involves building and decorating a personal mansion located at Key Biscayne, one of Miami's most prestigious locations [^ref-3][^ref-5]. As players win tournaments and complete solitaire games, they earn rewards that can be used to customize and expand their virtual estate, creating an aspirational narrative of success and luxury befitting the Roaring Twenties setting.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Hoyle Miami Solitaire utilizes a standard mouse-driven interface typical of casual card games, requiring only keyboard and mouse input [^ref-3]. The game is designed for accessibility, allowing players of all skill levels to engage with its content [^ref-3]. Cards can be moved via click-and-drag mechanics, with the interface optimized for the Windows operating environment.

### Structure and Progression

The game offers two distinct gameplay modes to accommodate different player preferences [^ref-3]:

- **Quick Play Mode:** Allows immediate access to any of the 55+ solitaire variations for casual, pick-up-and-play sessions
- **Story Mode:** A structured progression through 100 levels of tournament play, tied to the 1920s Miami narrative and mansion-building mechanics

Tournament progression unlocks various rewards including 16 official Hoyle card backs and decorative items for the Key Biscayne mansion feature [^ref-3][^ref-5]. This dual-mode approach ensures both casual players seeking quick entertainment and dedicated players looking for long-term goals can find satisfaction.

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The game includes over 55 different solitaire variations, providing extensive variety for card game enthusiasts [^ref-3][^ref-5]. Among these are four new and exclusive Hoyle games not found in previous compilations [^ref-3]. The solitaire variants range from well-known classics to more obscure variations, ensuring that "you'll find some solitaire games here that can't be found elsewhere" [^ref-8].

The mansion decoration system serves as a meta-game layer, giving players tangible rewards for their card-playing progress [^ref-3][^ref-5]. Additionally, four hidden bonus games can be unlocked, including a game called "The Mill," adding discovery elements to the experience [^ref-5].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Hoyle Miami Solitaire received mixed to positive reviews from the casual gaming press. Gamezebo awarded the game a score of 70/100, with reviewer Joel Brodie praising it as "a collection of over 55 original diversions officially branded by the leading name in PC and tabletop playing card manufacturing" and noting that players "won't find a classier, or more relaxing, casual amusement around" [^ref-5]. Brodie further observed that while "Hoyle Miami Solitaire might not be the most awe-inspiring offering of its kind, but it does an excellent job of capturing both the authentic pastime (and metropolis on which it's based)'s sunny disposition" [^ref-5].

The game's themed approach was generally well-received, with the product description emphasizing that "Hoyle puts a new twist on a classic favourite! Inspired by Miami's vibrant Art Deco and Latin styles, this solitaire game will mesmerise players of all levels!" [^ref-3].

## Development

### Origins

Hoyle Miami Solitaire represents Encore Software's continuation of the Hoyle brand, which had long been associated with Sierra Entertainment in the gaming industry [^ref-7]. The Hoyle name carried significant weight in the card and board game software market, representing "the leading name in PC and tabletop playing card manufacturing" [^ref-5]. By 2006, the brand had passed to Encore Software, who sought to distinguish their releases through unique thematic presentations.

### Production

The game was developed and published by Encore Software, a company known for budget-priced software releases [^ref-1][^ref-2][^ref-11]. Distribution in PAL territories was handled by Mindscape, who marketed the title to European and Australian audiences [^ref-3]. Big Fish Games also served as a digital distribution partner, making the game available through their casual gaming portal [^ref-6].

The development team chose Miami's 1920s Art Deco period as their thematic hook, likely recognizing the appeal of vintage glamour to the casual gaming demographic [^ref-3][^ref-5]. The inclusion of a mansion-building feature reflected broader casual gaming trends of the era, which increasingly incorporated progression systems and collectible elements.

The game's commercial status is listed as "No Longer Available" in retail channels, indicating it has passed out of active distribution [^ref-3].

### Critical Perspective

Hoyle Miami Solitaire represents an interesting inflection point in the history of the venerable Hoyle gaming brand. Originally associated with Sierra Entertainment's long-running series of card and board game compilations dating back to the late 1980s, the Hoyle name had become synonymous with officially branded digital card gaming [^ref-7][^ref-9]. The transition to Encore Software marked a shift toward more budget-focused, thematically adventurous releases.

The game's approach of combining traditional solitaire gameplay with a specific historical setting and narrative wrapper anticipated later casual gaming trends that would become more pronounced with the rise of mobile gaming. While not groundbreaking, Hoyle Miami Solitaire delivered on its promise of providing accessible, relaxing card gaming entertainment wrapped in an appealing aesthetic package. As Gamezebo noted, the game successfully captured "the authentic pastime (and metropolis on which it's based)'s sunny disposition" [^ref-5].
