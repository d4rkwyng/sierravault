<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 22, 2026</small>

## Overview

Hoyle Slots and Video Poker 2000 is a casino simulation game released by Sierra Attractions in 2000, designed to replicate the Las Vegas casino experience on personal computers[^ref-7]. The title was part of Sierra's extensive Hoyle series, which originated in 1989 with Hoyle's Official Book of Games and was named after the 18th-century card game authority Edmond Hoyle[^ref-2]. The game promised players "all the payoffs of casino Slots and video Poker without leaving home," capturing the sights and sounds of authentic casino floors[^ref-3].

As a dedicated slots and video poker title, the game distinguished itself from the broader Hoyle Casino releases by focusing specifically on these machine-based gambling games[^ref-4]. The package featured 275 variations of slots ranging from classic one-armed bandits to modern video slots, along with 44 variations of video poker including popular variants like Joker Poker, Jacks or Better, and Deuces Wild[^ref-3]. This specialized approach catered to players who preferred the quick, luck-based excitement of slot machines over traditional table games.

The game was released during a period when PC gaming was experiencing significant growth, and casino simulation titles had carved out a reliable niche in the entertainment software market[^ref-2]. Hoyle Slots and Video Poker 2000 was compatible with both Windows and Macintosh platforms, making it accessible to a broad audience of home computer users[^ref-3][^ref-5]. The title was later republished by Encore Software as part of their continued stewardship of the Hoyle brand after Sierra Entertainment ceased direct publication of the series[^ref-6].

## Story Summary

As a casino simulation game, Hoyle Slots and Video Poker 2000 does not feature a traditional narrative structure[^ref-4]. Instead, the game places players in a virtual Las Vegas casino environment where the objective is to accumulate winnings through strategic play and fortunate outcomes[^ref-3]. Players begin with a default stake of $5,000 and can choose their level of risk through various denomination options ranging from 5¢ to $1,000[^ref-4].

The setting recreates the atmosphere of an authentic Las Vegas casino floor, complete with ambient sights and sounds designed to immerse players in the gambling experience[^ref-6]. Players navigate through the casino selecting from dozens of different machine types, each with its own theme, payout structure, and gameplay mechanics[^ref-4].

A bonus Horse Racing game is included, adding variety to the core slots and poker experience and providing an additional avenue for players to test their luck[^ref-3]. This supplementary feature expanded the game's appeal beyond purely machine-based gambling, though the primary focus remained firmly on slots and video poker gameplay.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Hoyle Slots and Video Poker 2000 utilizes a first-person perspective that places players directly in front of the various gambling machines[^ref-4]. The interface is menu-based and designed for point-and-click interaction, allowing players to easily navigate the casino floor and select their preferred machines[^ref-8]. The game employs turn-based pacing appropriate for gambling simulations, with each spin or hand representing a discrete gameplay moment[^ref-8].

Players interact with slot machines by selecting their bet amount, choosing the number of paylines to activate where applicable, and initiating spins[^ref-4]. Video poker machines follow traditional draw poker conventions, allowing players to hold and discard cards to build the strongest possible hand[^ref-6]. Quick hints and strategies are available to assist less experienced players in understanding optimal play[^ref-3].

### Structure and Progression

The game structure is open-ended, allowing players to freely explore different machines and betting strategies without following a prescribed progression path[^ref-4]. Players can choose from multiple denomination levels to suit their preferred risk tolerance:

- **5¢ Machines:** Entry-level betting for cautious play
- **10¢ to $1 Machines:** Standard denomination range
- **$5 to $100 Machines:** High-stakes options for experienced players
- **$500 to $1,000 Machines:** Maximum risk, maximum reward denominations[^ref-4]

The game tracks player bankrolls throughout sessions, with the goal being to maximize winnings while managing risk. Payout rates across machines range from 92% to 100%, simulating the variable return percentages found in actual casinos[^ref-4].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

While not featuring traditional puzzles, Hoyle Slots and Video Poker 2000 incorporates strategic decision-making elements, particularly in its video poker gameplay[^ref-6]. Players must evaluate their initial hands and make optimal hold/discard decisions based on probability and expected value. The game provides hints and strategy guides to help players improve their decision-making[^ref-3].

Slot machine play is primarily luck-based, though players must manage their bankroll strategically across sessions and make informed choices about denomination levels and machine selection based on payout rates[^ref-4].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Hoyle Slots and Video Poker 2000 received mixed reception from consumers and reviewers. Amazon customer reviews recorded an average rating of 1.0 out of 5 stars based on limited reviews, suggesting significant dissatisfaction among some purchasers[^ref-3]. However, GameFAQs users rated the game more favorably, with a "Good" aggregate rating based on 2 user reviews[^ref-5].

The game was marketed primarily as a casual entertainment product rather than a hardcore gaming experience, positioning it for a demographic that may not have extensively participated in traditional gaming review culture[^ref-2]. Contemporary gaming publications focused more heavily on narrative-driven titles and AAA releases, leaving niche casino simulation games with relatively sparse critical coverage.

### Modern Assessment

Modern assessment of the title reflects its status as a period-specific casual gaming product. The game has maintained a collector's market presence, with used copies available on sites like eBay and Amazon at prices ranging from $0.99 to $6.99[^ref-2]. This modest pricing reflects both the game's age and the relatively limited demand for legacy casino simulation software.

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **GameFAQs:** "Good" rating (2 user ratings)[^ref-5]
- **Amazon:** 1.0/5 stars (1 review)[^ref-3]

The ELSPA (Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association) rated the game as suitable for ages 3 and up in European markets[^ref-4], while the ESRB assigned an "E for Everyone" rating in North America[^ref-6].

## Development

### Origins

The Hoyle series was established by Sierra On-Line in 1989 with Hoyle's Official Book of Games, creating a respected brand for digital card and casino gaming experiences[^ref-2]. The series name honored Edmond Hoyle, the 18th-century writer known as the father of card game rules and standards[^ref-2]. By 2000, the Hoyle brand had expanded to encompass numerous specialized titles covering different aspects of traditional gaming.

Hoyle Slots and Video Poker 2000 emerged as a focused entry in the series, extracting the slot machine and video poker elements from the broader Hoyle Casino package to create a dedicated product for enthusiasts of these specific game types[^ref-4]. This specialization strategy allowed Sierra to market multiple Hoyle products simultaneously to different consumer segments.

### Production

Development was handled internally at Sierra On-Line, with publication managed through the Sierra Attractions label[^ref-7][^ref-3]. The game was designed for broad compatibility across Windows operating systems of the era, including Windows 95, 98, 2000, and ME[^ref-2]. A Macintosh version was developed concurrently to maximize market reach[^ref-3].

The production incorporated authentic casino sound effects and visual design to create an immersive gambling atmosphere[^ref-6]. Horse racing announcer speech and various animations were included on the CD-ROM, though some features could be disabled to allow the game to run without the disc in the drive[^ref-4].

### Technical Achievements

The game featured realistic casino floor recreation with attention to atmospheric detail[^ref-3]. Multiple machine themes provided visual variety, with each slot machine featuring unique graphics appropriate to its theme (alien invasion, safari, diamonds, etc.)[^ref-4]. The audio design incorporated authentic mechanical sounds of slot machines alongside period-appropriate electronic effects.

### Technical Specifications

**CD-ROM Version:**[^ref-6]
- **Resolution:** 640x480, 16-bit color

The game could operate without the CD inserted, though this disabled certain features including the horse racing announcer's speech and several animations[^ref-4].

### Technical Issues

The Hoyle Casino series experienced technical difficulties in some iterations, particularly the 2007 version which was plagued by a bug causing a 30-second freeze after placing bets[^ref-9]. This bug was not fixed by Encore, requiring customers to request refunds, though it was eventually addressed in the 2008 version[^ref-9]. Whether this specific issue affected Hoyle Slots and Video Poker is unclear from available documentation.

- The game could be played without the CD in the drive, but "some features of the game are disabled" according to the manual, including the horse racing announcer's speech and several animations[^ref-4]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

While specific sales figures for Hoyle Slots and Video Poker 2000 are not available, the broader Hoyle Casino 2000 sold 230,365 units and earned $6.15 million from January through October 2000[^ref-9]. This indicates strong market performance for the Hoyle brand during this period, suggesting healthy sales across related titles in the series.

The game was marketed at retail price during its initial release and has since transitioned to the secondary market, where copies are commonly available at significantly reduced prices[^ref-2]. The title's inclusion in larger collections like the Ultimate Hoyle Anniversary Collection helped extend its commercial lifespan[^ref-2].

### Collections

Hoyle Slots and Video Poker 2000 appeared in various compilations:

- **Ultimate Hoyle Anniversary Collection** – Featured alongside other Hoyle card, board, and casino games[^ref-2]
- Various Sierra Attractions budget compilations during the early 2000s

### Publisher Transition

After 2005, publication of the Hoyle series transferred from Sierra Entertainment to Encore, Inc.[^ref-9] Encore continued to market Hoyle Slots and Video Poker through various retail channels, maintaining the brand's presence in the budget gaming market[^ref-6][^ref-2]. The Encore edition was listed on Newegg as first appearing on March 29, 2007[^ref-6].

### Related Publications

- **Game Manual:** Included with retail package, documenting machine types and gameplay features[^ref-4]
- Standard Sierra Attractions packaging with UPC documentation[^ref-7]

### Critical Perspective

Hoyle Slots and Video Poker 2000 represents a specific moment in PC gaming history when casual entertainment software occupied significant retail shelf space alongside more ambitious gaming titles. The game served a clear market function: providing safe, legal gambling entertainment for adults who enjoyed casino games but preferred the convenience and zero-risk environment of home computer play[^ref-2].

The title's focus on slots and video poker—games that require minimal strategic depth compared to table games like poker or blackjack—positioned it as accessible entertainment rather than a serious gambling simulation[^ref-6]. This approach attracted casual players seeking relaxation rather than competition, though it may have limited appeal for more dedicated gaming audiences seeking depth and challenge.

The Hoyle brand's transition from Sierra to Encore reflected broader industry consolidation, as major publishers divested casual gaming properties to specialized budget software distributors[^ref-9]. Today, the game stands as an artifact of pre-smartphone casual gaming, when dedicated PC software filled entertainment niches now primarily served by mobile applications and web-based games.
