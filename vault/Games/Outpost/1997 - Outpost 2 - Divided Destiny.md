## Overview

Outpost 2: Divided Destiny is a real-time strategy game developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra On-Line in 1997[^ref-1]. Unlike traditional real-time strategy games, Outpost 2 emphasizes colony management over the destruction of enemies[^ref-2]. The game is set on a distant planet called New Terra, where the last survivors of humanity must build sustainable colonies after Earth was destroyed by an asteroid impact known as Vulcan's Hammer[^ref-3][^ref-4].

The game focuses on the happiness and survival of the colonists - the last remaining survivors of an Earth catastrophe[^ref-5]. Players must manage complex colony systems while dealing with environmental disasters, resource scarcity, and the spreading threat of a terraforming microbe gone wrong called "the Blight"[^ref-6]. Over time, two colonies arise that have different goals in rebuilding humanity[^ref-7], creating the central conflict that drives the game's narrative.

## Story Summary

The story begins after Earth has been devastated by an asteroid impact, forcing the last survivors to journey to a distant planet called New Terra[^ref-9]. The game's backstory reveals that "the earth, is dead. As the asteroid fragments landed, the last few survivors departed the solar system, seeking a new home among the stars"[^ref-10]. The colonists' situation becomes desperate when their secret terraforming experiments produce a deadly side effect - a mutated microbe spreading through the planet's crust that scientists call the "Blight"[^ref-6].

The narrative is driven by survival missions where players must evacuate colonies as disasters strike. Early missions involve urgent evacuations with briefings stating "Something has gone horribly wrong. We must evacuate the colony immediately"[^ref-6]. The story explores themes of human survival and the consequences of scientific experimentation, as the colonists must deal with contaminated expeditions where "once our units enter the infected area, they will be carriers of the Blight"[^ref-6]. The game's tagline "Extinction is not an option" underscores the desperate nature of humanity's struggle for survival[^ref-11]. The dual campaign structure allows players to experience the conflict from both Plymouth and Eden perspectives, revealing different aspects of the overarching narrative and the ideological differences driving the factions apart. Character development through mission briefings adds emotional weight to what could otherwise feel like abstract colony management, making players invested in the fate of humanity's last survivors.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The game features a top-down perspective with mouse and keyboard controls[^ref-12]. Players interact with the game world by left-clicking and right-clicking on various structures and units. To increase factory production, players must left-click and right-click on buildings[^ref-13]. The interface emphasizes colony management systems over traditional military command structures found in other RTS games.

### Structure and Progression

Outpost 2 offers three distinct game modes: Campaign, Colony, and Multiplayer[^ref-14]. The campaign mode includes two single-player campaigns that follow different colonial factions[^ref-15]. Players can choose between Eden and Plymouth colonies, each with unique advantages and disadvantages[^ref-5]. The game features mission-based gameplay with varying map sizes, including 64x64 tiles for Mission 1 and 128x64 tiles for Mission 2[^ref-16].

The ultimate goal is to build a spaceship and escape from New Terra, a planet that is ravaged by a terraforming microbe gone bad[^ref-12]. The game supports up to 6 players in multiplayer mode via network or the Sierra gaming service[^ref-17].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Morale is a critical factor for the colony, and because it can fluctuate rapidly, much of the player's attention is spent on ensuring that it remains at optimal levels[^ref-2]. The game emphasizes resource management, technological research, and careful planning rather than military conquest. Players must balance various colony needs including food production, housing, research facilities, and defense against environmental hazards.

The game includes over 140 vehicles and buildings, more than 2,000 terrain types, and over 60,000 animation frames[^ref-15]. Combat exists but is secondary to survival mechanics, with some critics noting that "everything shoots lasers" and combat moves "slower than a sloth in a tar pit"[^ref-18]. The two playable factions—Plymouth and Eden—offer different playstyles and technological approaches, with Plymouth focusing on mobile, flexible colonies and Eden emphasizing fortified, stationary settlements.

The Blight mechanic creates escalating tension throughout the campaign. This spreading contamination forces players to continuously relocate their colonies, abandoning infrastructure and racing to establish new settlements before the Blight catches up. Resource scarcity becomes increasingly critical as the game progresses, requiring careful management of ore deposits and recycling programs.

## Research Tree

The research system in Outpost 2 offered extensive technological development paths tailored to each faction's philosophy. Plymouth and Eden maintained distinct tech trees, with Plymouth emphasizing mobility and adaptability while Eden focused on fortified defense and resource efficiency. Research priorities significantly impacted gameplay, as certain technologies unlocked powerful units or critical infrastructure improvements. The branching structure forced meaningful choices, as pursuing one research path meant delaying others. Advanced technologies required prerequisite discoveries, creating satisfying progression as colonies evolved from basic survival operations to sophisticated civilizations capable of escaping the doomed planet. The research system complemented the survival narrative, as technological advancement represented humanity's best hope for outliving the Blight.

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| The Adrenaline Vault | 3.5/5 | Praised structured campaign play and colony survival challenge[^ref-1] |
| GameSpot | 5/10 (Mediocre) | Criticized as "The Hurry Up and Wait game" due to slow pacing[^ref-19] |
| Computer Gaming World | 3.5/5 | Called it "an excellent attempt to resurrect this franchise" but noted "limited vision"[^ref-1] |
| GameFabrique | 7/10 | Heavily criticized the slow pacing, calling it "one to avoid"[^ref-18] |

### Modern Assessment

Modern user reviews have been more favorable than contemporary professional reviews. GOG.com user reviews aggregate to 4.3/5 based on 46 user reviews[^ref-8]. Metacritic users rate the game 8.3/10[^ref-20], while MyAbandonware gives it 4.75/5[^ref-5]. GameFAQs users rate it as "Great" based on 24 ratings[^ref-14]. 

User reviews often praise the game's unique approach to the RTS genre. One reviewer noted it's "an RTS not centered around combat" where "the conflict here is not against some enemy force, but against nature itself"[^ref-8]. Another user called it "a classic but underrated game that expertly mixed city building with RTS elements"[^ref-20].

## Development

### Origins

Outpost 2: Divided Destiny was developed as a sequel to the original Outpost from 1994[^ref-3]. The original Outpost had received poor reception, leading Sierra to pass development to Dynamix for the sequel[^ref-19]. A professional science fiction author was brought in to develop the plot and backstory[^ref-5], and the game includes a novella by J. Steven York[^ref-12].

### Production

The development team was led by designers Allen McPheeters and Pat Cook[^ref-1]. Charles Barth composed the music[^ref-1], while Kathy Cullis provided the voice of the Savant Computer[^ref-1]. The designers approached the sequel methodically to avoid the mistakes of the original, resulting in technically sound but sometimes criticized as dull gameplay[^ref-19].

### Technical Achievements

The game was built with impressive technical specifications for its time, featuring over 2,000 terrain types, more than 140 vehicles and buildings, and over 60,000 animation frames[^ref-15]. System requirements included a Pentium 90 processor, 16 MB RAM, 32k colors, 4X CD-ROM drive, and 16-bit sound card[^ref-18]. The game supported SVGA 256 colors and required 4:3 resolution[^ref-17].

### Version History

| Version | Date | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| 1.0 | 1997 | Initial retail release |
| 1.2 | 2020 | GOG.com digital re-release with modern compatibility[^ref-22] |

## Legacy

Despite mixed contemporary reviews, Outpost 2 has maintained an active community of players and developers who continue to support and develop content for the game[^ref-21]. The Sierra Internet Gaming System (SIGS) that originally supported online play has been discontinued, but the game is now commonly played through virtual networks like Hamachi[^ref-2]. This dedicated community has kept multiplayer alive long after official support ended.

The game has been preserved and made available through modern digital distribution platforms like GOG.com, which released version 1.2 in 2020[^ref-22]. The community continues to create new content, with scenario packs and updates still being developed decades after the original release[^ref-23]. The Outpost2.net community[^ref-21] serves as the primary hub for fans, hosting forums, downloads, and documentation for both new and returning players.

Outpost 2 represents an interesting experiment in RTS design—a game that prioritized survival and colony management over the military conquest that dominated the genre in the late 1990s. While this approach limited its mass-market appeal, it created a devoted niche following that appreciates the game's unique challenges and atmosphere. The science fiction setting, combined with the included novella by J. Steven York[^ref-12], created a richly imagined world that resonated with fans of hard science fiction.

The game's themes of environmental disaster, resource scarcity, and human survival feel increasingly relevant decades after release, perhaps contributing to its enduring appeal among strategy gaming enthusiasts. For players seeking an alternative to traditional RTS gameplay focused on destruction, Outpost 2 offers a thought-provoking experience that rewards careful planning and resource management over aggressive expansion.
