# Quest for Glory III: Wages of War

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview
Quest for Glory III: Wages of War is a 1992 hybrid adventure/role-playing game developed and published by [[Sierra On-Line]] for MS-DOS[^ref-1][^ref-2]. Designed by [[Corey Cole]] and [[Lori Ann Cole]], it is the third entry in the Quest for Glory series and the sequel to Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire[^ref-1]. The game was the first in the series to use VGA graphics and a point-and-click interface, abandoning the text parser of previous entries[^ref-1][^ref-3]. Set in Fricana, a land inspired by central African ecosystems, the game explores themes of tribal conflict and features Liontaurs, half-human half-lion creatures[^ref-1]. According to Corey Cole, the game was developed with a budget of $750,000[^ref-1]. Lori Cole was responsible for "90% of the design work" while also supervising the VGA remake of Quest for Glory I[^ref-1].

## Story Summary
Rakeesh the Paladin brings the Hero (now Prince of Shapeir) along with Uhura and her son Simba to his homeland, the town of Tarna in Fricana, a jungle and savannah country inspired by central African ecosystems[^ref-1][^ref-3]. Fricana is home to Liontaurs, half-human half-lion creatures[^ref-1]. The Liontaur city of Tarna is on the brink of war; the Simbani, the tribe of Uhura, are ready to do battle with the Leopardmen[^ref-1].

Both tribes have taken a sacred relic from the other and refused to return it before the other does[^ref-1][^ref-3]. The Hero must prevent the war and then thwart a demon who may be loosed upon the world[^ref-1]. The Hero earns membership in the warring tribes and leads his newfound allies into battle against the demon wizard[^ref-1].

As soon as the battle is won, the Hero suddenly disappears into darkness[^ref-1][^ref-3]. This cliffhanger ending sets up the events of Quest for Glory: Shadows of Darkness. Quest for Glory II had hinted that villain Ad Avis would return in this installment, but the Coles felt a darker game wouldn't reach new audiences, so that plotline was saved for the fourth game[^ref-1].

## Gameplay

Like previous installments, the game offers three standard character classes: Warrior, Magic User, and Thief[^ref-1][^ref-3]. The Fighter class is favored in Wages of War with access to the Trials of Simbani quests, while Magic Users are treated with hostility and Thieves have limited class-specific content[^ref-1][^ref-4].

### Interface and Controls
- First game in series to use VGA graphics and point-and-click interface[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- Replaced text parser from previous games with mouse-driven controls[^ref-3]
- Character import from Quest for Glory II with stats and inventory[^ref-3]

### Structure and Progression
- Features an "overworld" screen where cities and landmarks are represented in miniature, departing from interconnected screens of previous games[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- Travel across the overworld is subject to random encounters with enemies[^ref-1]
- Time passes rapidly while traveling between landmarks[^ref-1]
- Stealthy Thief characters are less prone to random encounters[^ref-1]

### Puzzles and Mechanics
- Characters who proved honorable in QFG II can be imported as Paladins[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- Any saved character can be changed to a different class, including Paladin, before starting[^ref-1]
- Magic Users can create a magical staff that allows spellcasting without mana cost[^ref-3]
- Only game in series without houses to steal from or a Thieves' Guild[^ref-3]
- Due to a programming oversight, it is impossible to achieve a perfect score[^ref-1]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews
Computer Gaming World gave the game a positive review in January 1993[^ref-1]. Dragon magazine awarded the game 5 out of 5 stars in April 1993[^ref-1]. White Wolf Magazine's Jim Trunzo rated it 4/5 in January/February 1993[^ref-1]. In August 1994, PC Gamer US ranked Quest for Glory III as the 28th best computer game ever[^ref-1].

### Modern Assessment
Michael Baker for RPGamer gave the game 3 out of 5 stars, feeling it "could have been much more involved and exciting than it actually was" and criticizing the combat system and VGA graphics utilization compared to the EGA graphics of the previous entry[^ref-1][^ref-4]. Richard Cobbett of PC Gamer considers the title "a bit of a filler of a game"[^ref-1][^ref-5].

Adventure Gamers rated the game 3/5 (Decent), calling it "certainly not a bad game, but there are few notable positive aspects, making Wages of War the weakest game in the series"[^ref-6]. The Adventure Gamer blog gave it 68/100 using their PISSED rating system[^ref-17]. IMDB users rate it 8.1/10[^ref-18]. HowLongToBeat reports the main story takes approximately 8 hours to complete, with completionist runs taking about 15 hours[^ref-9]. Speedrunners have achieved completion times under 12 minutes[^ref-19].

## Development

### Production
The game was created using Sierra's SCI1.1 interpreter, marking the first VGA game in the series[^ref-1][^ref-3]. Development budget was $750,000[^ref-1]. Lori Cole handled 90% of the design work while simultaneously supervising the VGA remake of Quest for Glory I[^ref-1]. The game contains cameos by Sanford and Son as merchants in Tarna, and Laurel and Hardy as French Foreign Legion soldiers[^ref-3].

### Technical Achievements
- First Quest for Glory game with VGA graphics[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- First in series to use point-and-click interface[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- Introduced overworld map system for travel[^ref-1]
- Development budget of $750,000[^ref-1]
- Lori Cole handled 90% of design work while supervising the VGA remake of Quest for Glory I[^ref-1]
- Platform release: August 1992 MS-DOS[^ref-1]

### Easter Eggs and Cameos
The game contains several pop culture references[^ref-20]:
- Sanford and Son appear as merchants in Tarna[^ref-3]
- Laurel and Hardy appear as French Foreign Legion soldiers[^ref-3]
- Due to a programming oversight, it is impossible to achieve a perfect score in the game[^ref-1]

## Legacy

Quest for Glory III holds a significant place in the series' technical evolution as the transitional game that moved the franchise from text parser to point-and-click interface, and from EGA to VGA graphics[^ref-1][^ref-3]. These innovations established the visual and interface standards for the remainder of the series. The game's overworld map system for travel between locations also represented a departure from the interconnected screens of previous entries, influencing the design of subsequent installments[^ref-1].

The game is notable for being the only entry in the series without a Thieves' Guild or houses to rob, making it the least favorable for Thief characters[^ref-3]. This design choice reflected the African-inspired setting where such Western guild structures would be anachronistic. The game was originally intended to be "Shadows of Darkness" with the villain Ad Avis, but the Coles changed direction to a lighter African-themed adventure to appeal to new audiences[^ref-1]. The dramatic cliffhanger ending, with the Hero disappearing into darkness, directly sets up the events of Quest for Glory: Shadows of Darkness[^ref-1][^ref-3].

While often considered a transitional entry by modern critics—with solid mechanics but a less engaging plot compared to predecessors—Quest for Glory III served as an important bridge between the EGA era and the fully-realized VGA games that followed[^ref-1][^ref-5][^ref-6]. The Quest for Glory series as a whole pioneered the hybrid adventure-RPG genre, blending puzzle-solving narratives with character progression systems, and QFG III's technical innovations helped establish this formula for future titles[^ref-3].
