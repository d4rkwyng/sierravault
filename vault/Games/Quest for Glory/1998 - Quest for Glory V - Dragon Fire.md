# Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 31, 2026</small>

## Overview
Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire is the fifth and final game in the Quest for Glory series, developed by Yosemite Entertainment and published by Sierra FX on December 8, 1998 for Windows[^ref-1][^ref-2]. Designed primarily by [[Lori Ann Cole]] (with [[Corey Cole]] handling programming), the game marks a significant departure from its predecessors by being primarily an action role-playing game rather than a traditional adventure-RPG hybrid[^ref-1][^ref-6]. The game was always planned as part of the series (whereas Wages of War originally was not), but it would not have been produced if not for fans' enthusiasm and their pleas to Sierra On-Line[^ref-1][^ref-4]. Dragon Fire features polygonal 3D characters over pre-rendered 2D backgrounds, making it one of the earliest adopters of a 3D character creation system, predating EverQuest and Asheron's Call[^ref-1]. The soundtrack by Emmy-winning composer Chance Thomas was released on CD, selling 50,000 copies and generating $500,000 in revenue prior to the game's launch[^ref-1].

## Story Summary
The wizard Erasmus introduces the Hero to the Greece-like kingdom of Silmaria, whose king was recently assassinated[^ref-1][^ref-4]. The traditional Rites of Rulership are due to commence, and the victor will be crowned king[^ref-1]. The Hero enters the contest with the assistance of Erasmus, Rakeesh, and many old friends from previous entries in the series[^ref-1][^ref-4].

The Hero competes against several competitors, including the Silmarian guard Kokeeno Pookameeso, the warlord Magnum Opus, the hulking Gort, and the warrior Elsa Von Spielburg, who played a significant role in the first game[^ref-1][^ref-4]. As the Rites commence, an unknown assassin begins systematically picking off the contestants[^ref-1]. Each contestant is murdered by a poison dagger near Dragon Pillars, the objects used to keep the Dragon of Silmaria locked up[^ref-1][^ref-4].

After completing the second Rite, Rakeesh is attacked by the assassin and, depending on the player's choices, either lives or dies[^ref-1]. The conspiracy is eventually unraveled and the Dragon, having been released due to the destruction of the Dragon Pillars, is defeated[^ref-1]. The characters Katrina and Erana make a return in this installment as assistance for defeating the Dragon[^ref-1][^ref-4]. Bruno from the first Quest for Glory game is revealed to be the assassin terrorizing the streets of Silmaria[^ref-1][^ref-4].

## Gameplay

Unlike the first four games, which were mostly adventure games incorporating role-playing elements, Dragon Fire is a role-playing game incorporating some adventure elements[^ref-1][^ref-4]. The game features a wide variety of weapons, armor, and magical items not present in earlier entries, and nearly every major mission consists of combat encounters[^ref-1][^ref-6].

### Interface and Controls
- Point-and-click graphical interface with new combat system[^ref-1]
- Real-time battles taking place in the main environment rather than isolated combat screens[^ref-1]
- 3D polygonal characters over 2D pre-rendered backgrounds[^ref-1]
- Character import from previous Quest for Glory games[^ref-4]

### Structure and Progression
- Seven Rites of Rulership serve as main quest progression[^ref-1][^ref-4]
- Open world exploration of Silmaria and surrounding areas[^ref-4]
- Multiple character classes with different solutions[^ref-4]
- Non-linear quest completion within each Rite[^ref-4]

### Puzzles and Mechanics
- Romance options with multiple characters including Katrina and Erana[^ref-1][^ref-4]
- Branching story paths affecting character fates[^ref-1]
- Real-time action combat replacing turn-based or side-scrolling systems[^ref-1]
- Cut features due to deadline pressures: bow weapons, playable Elsa/Magnum Opus, multiplayer[^ref-1][^ref-4]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews
GameSpot's Elliott Chin scored the game 7.4/10 (Good), noting that "Quest for Glory V has a few quirks and problems that will try your patience, but series fans will want to play this game to see old friends and follow Hero's last adventure"[^ref-17]. He praised the game's continuity with the series, stating "The humor and style of the previous Quest games is wholly intact in this final chapter"[^ref-17]. IGN's Trent C. Ward gave the game 6.6/10, criticizing the combat system while acknowledging that "the graphics this time around are spectacular"[^ref-18].

Next Generation summarized the game as "a fine contribution to the genre that is accessible to novice and expert gamers alike"[^ref-1]. Joshua Darien Maciel of RPGamer scored the game 9 out of 10 points, considering it a polished and seamless combination of combat and gameplay[^ref-1][^ref-19]. Dragon Fire was a nominee for CNET Gamecenter's 1998 "Adventure Game of the Year" award, which ultimately went to Grim Fandango[^ref-1]. Adventure Classic Gaming's Greg Wallace gave it 4/5 stars, calling composer Chance Thomas's work "the finest musical scores ever found in an adventure game" while criticizing the combat as "an infuriating and confusing clicking frenzy"[^ref-20].

### Modern Assessment
Adam Rosenberg of G4TV considers Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire the best entry in the series[^ref-1]. Griffin McElroy of Polygon positively characterized the game as "fan service" for fans of its predecessors[^ref-1]. However, Rowan Kaizer of Engadget considers this entry the worst of the series, largely due to its use of primitive 3D graphics[^ref-1]. Richard Cobbett of PC Gamer considers the game a "stumble" due to the 3D graphics and arcade action gameplay[^ref-1][^ref-5].

Adventure Gamers rated the game 3/5 (Decent), noting "The fifth Quest for Glory has some questionable design issues, but it's still a decent title with enough entertaining elements to enjoy a Hero's final quest"[^ref-6]. Just Adventure gave it an A- grade[^ref-21], while Quandary rated it 3/5[^ref-21]. PC Zone UK was more critical with 68/100[^ref-21]. HowLongToBeat reports the main story takes approximately 15 hours to complete, with completionist runs taking about 42 hours[^ref-7]. GameFAQs users rated it "Great" with 72 ratings[^ref-8]. The speedrun community has achieved completion times as low as 21 minutes through exploit routing[^ref-22].

## Development

### Production
The first four games in the series were intended to indicate the four elements and four wind directions: in the first game, the player is the Hero from the East, in the second from the North, etc[^ref-1][^ref-4]. Lori Cole was predominantly responsible for Dragon Fire's design, as Corey Cole was preoccupied with programming[^ref-1]. The game originally had a voxel engine, which was later changed to a 3D engine because of hardware limitations[^ref-1].

Because of deadline issues and financial pressures, several features were dropped before release, including the ability to use a bow, the ability to play as Elsa von Spielburg or Magnum Opus, and multiplayer capability[^ref-1][^ref-4]. A demo released in late 1997 contained a multiplayer game, but Sierra decided to remove it from the final product[^ref-1]. The entire Quest for Glory programming team was laid off when Yosemite Entertainment was closed on February 22, 1999[^ref-1][^ref-4].

Jenny Jordan provided vocals for "The Dance of Mystery and Intrigue" and "The Rite of Destiny," while Thomas himself performed the vocal chant for "The Rite of Peace"[^ref-26]. RPGFan praised the orchestral score as one of the game's strongest elements[^ref-27].

## Legacy

Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire represents a divisive conclusion to the beloved series[^ref-1]. The game underwent a significant genre shift—while the first four Quest for Glory games were graphic adventures with RPG elements, Dragon Fire is an RPG with adventure elements[^ref-28]. This made combat a much larger part of the game, particularly notable since previous games allowed thieves and magic users to complete with minimal fighting[^ref-28]. While some critics like Adam Rosenberg of G4TV consider it the best entry, others like Rowan Kaizer of Engadget consider it the weakest due to this shift and the primitive 3D graphics[^ref-1].

The game's setting, inspired by ancient Greek myths and legends, introduces Silmaria as a land reminiscent of classical Greece with elements like the Rites of Rulership, Atlantis mythology, and creatures such as the Hydra and Cerberus[^ref-28]. Despite mixed reception, the game provided closure to the Hero's journey with numerous characters returning for the finale—including Elsa von Spielburg, Erasmus, Rakeesh, and villains like Bruno and Baba Yaga[^ref-1][^ref-4][^ref-28]. Dragon Fire was a nominee for CNET Gamecenter's 1998 "Adventure Game of the Year" award, demonstrating that the game was well-received by contemporary critics despite later reassessments[^ref-1]. The closure of Yosemite Entertainment on February 22, 1999 ended any possibility of future entries, making Dragon Fire the definitive conclusion to the Quest for Glory saga[^ref-1][^ref-4].
