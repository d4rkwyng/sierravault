# Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview
Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire is a 1990 adventure/role-playing game developed and published by [[Sierra On-Line]] for MS-DOS and Amiga[^ref-1][^ref-2]. Designed by [[Lori Ann Cole]] and [[Corey Cole]], it is the sequel to Quest for Glory: So You Want to Be a Hero and continues the story of the Hero of Spielburg[^ref-1][^ref-3]. The game was the last EGA game created by Sierra On-Line, following development processes intended for the graphically superior VGA games, which made its development difficult[^ref-1][^ref-4]. The manual is illustrated by Marvel Comics artist Ernie Chan[^ref-1]. According to Corey Cole, the game cost $450,000 to develop[^ref-1]. Trial by Fire is the only game in the series that was never officially remade with VGA graphics by Sierra, though AGD Interactive released a free VGA fan remake in 2008[^ref-1][^ref-5].

## Story Summary
The story is inspired by various Middle Eastern myths and stories, including Arabian Nights[^ref-1]. Directly following from the events of the first game, the newly proclaimed Hero of Spielburg travels by flying carpet with his friends Abdulla Doo, Shameen and Shema to the desert city of Shapeir[^ref-1][^ref-3]. The city is threatened by magical elementals of fire, earth, wind, and water, while the Emir Arus al-Din of Shapeir's sister city Raseir is missing and his city has fallen under tyranny[^ref-1].

After defeating the four elementals that threaten Shapeir, the Hero travels to the city of Raseir, which is missing its emir[^ref-1]. There, he is imprisoned by Khaveen and under hypnosis helps the evil tyrannical wizard Ad Avis to resurrect the evil genie Iblis[^ref-1]. In the final fight, the Hero attacks the palace and battles with Ad Avis, who falls to his presumed death begging for assistance from his Dark Master[^ref-1][^ref-3].

As thanks for the Hero's success in liberating Raseir and restoring its lost splendor, the Sultan of Shapeir, Harun al-Rashid, rewards the Hero by adopting him as his son[^ref-1]. The game contains many references to classic films including Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon, as well as the Marx Brothers, Lawrence of Arabia, and Star Trek[^ref-1][^ref-3].

## Gameplay

The game follows the path of its predecessor, with distinctions in gameplay[^ref-1]. The interface is a text parser, which requires the player to input commands from a set (but unknown) list to have the character perform actions[^ref-1]. Unlike the original, Trial by Fire operates on a restricted time frame; the entire plot is concluded in 30 days[^ref-1][^ref-3].

### Interface and Controls
- Text parser interface requiring typed commands[^ref-1]
- Real-time combat system[^ref-1]
- Day/night cycle affecting gameplay and puzzle availability[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- Character import from Quest for Glory I with stats and inventory[^ref-3][^ref-7]

### Structure and Progression
- Most of the game takes place in the fictional city of Shapeir and its surrounds[^ref-1]
- Many puzzles do not appear or cannot be solved until certain days, keeping gameplay on a tight linear narrative[^ref-1]
- The game's maze-like city layout served as a primitive form of copy protection, making early quests difficult without the manual's map[^ref-1]
- Players can obtain a magical map that transports their character instantly to hotspots[^ref-1]

### Puzzles and Mechanics
- Players can advance their character and explore class-specific side-quests[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- A Magic User can earn the title of "Wizard" through challenges at the Wizards' Institute of Technocery[^ref-1]
- A Fighter may earn membership in the Eternal Order of Fighters[^ref-1]
- A Thief may perform several thefts, including stealing the Maltese Falcon[^ref-1]
- Cross-class quests are possible; characters can become a Wizard, complete every theft, and join the Eternal Order of Fighters[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- This is the first game where the Hero may be awarded the title of Paladin by acting honorably throughout the game[^ref-1][^ref-3]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews
In 1991, Dragon gave the game 5 out of 5 stars[^ref-1]. Computer Gaming World stated that the game was more linear and less replayable than its predecessor, but had an excellent conclusion[^ref-1]. UK magazine ACE gave the Amiga version a score of only 600 out of 1000, praising its size but criticizing average graphics, grating music, slowness, and the large amount of disk swapping needed[^ref-1]. However, Amiga Action was more favorable, rating the Amiga version 88% in July 1991[^ref-18]. ASM (German magazine) gave it an overall score of 10/12[^ref-18].

### Modern Assessment
Both Michael Baker and Tyler Willis of RPGamer gave the game 4 out of 5 stars, praising the game's strong narrative, superb writing, and graphical design[^ref-1][^ref-8]. In 2011, Adventure Gamers named Quest for Glory II the 81st-best adventure game ever released[^ref-1]. Adventure Gamers rated the game 3.5/5 (Good), calling it "a worthy sequel that has re-styled basic elements from So You Want To Be A Hero both positively and negatively"[^ref-9]. IMDB users rate it 8.4/10[^ref-19]. HowLongToBeat reports the main story takes approximately 8 hours to complete, with completionist runs taking about 16 hours[^ref-12]. Speedrunners have completed the game in under 9 minutes using exploits[^ref-20].

The free VGA fan remake by AGD Interactive (released August 24, 2008) brought the game to modern audiences with point-and-click interface, full voice acting, and updated graphics[^ref-5][^ref-21]. The remake received critical acclaim for faithfully preserving the original's gameplay while modernizing its presentation[^ref-21].

- **Dragon Magazine:** 5/5 stars (1991)[^ref-1]

## Development

### Production
Quest for Glory II cost $450,000 to develop, making it one of Sierra's more expensive EGA productions[^ref-1]. It was the last EGA game created by Sierra On-Line, developed using processes intended for VGA games[^ref-1][^ref-4]. The antagonist Ad Avis is named after Sierra's then-creative director Bill Davis, and the city Raseir is an anagram for "Sierra" - both chosen as subtle parodies referencing a changing atmosphere within Sierra, with Raseir depicted as an Orwellian city under a totalitarian dictator[^ref-1].

### Technical Achievements
- Last Quest for Glory game using EGA graphics[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- Last EGA game developed by Sierra On-Line[^ref-1]
- Development budget of $450,000[^ref-1]
- Complex 30-day time management system[^ref-1]
- Multiple class-specific quest lines and endings[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- First game in series to introduce the Paladin class[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- Manual illustrated by Marvel Comics artist Ernie Chan[^ref-1]
- Platform releases: November 1990 MS-DOS, 1991 Amiga[^ref-1][^ref-3]

### Easter Eggs and Cultural References

The game is filled with pop culture references and hidden jokes[^ref-22]:
- Characters named as parodies: Ad Avis (Bill Davis), Raseir (anagram of Sierra)[^ref-1]
- References to Casablanca, The Maltese Falcon, and Lawrence of Arabia[^ref-1][^ref-3]
- Marx Brothers and Star Trek homages[^ref-3]
- The Thieves' Guild includes a Maltese Falcon statue to steal[^ref-1]
- Raseir is depicted as an Orwellian city, a subtle parody of changing atmosphere within Sierra at the time[^ref-1]

## Legacy

Quest for Glory II is notable as the only game in the series that was never officially remade with VGA graphics by Sierra[^ref-1]. However, AGD Interactive released a free VGA point-and-click remake on August 24, 2008, using the Adventure Game Studio engine[^ref-1][^ref-5]. The remake includes full voice acting and updated graphics while maintaining the original's gameplay and story[^ref-5].

The game is also notable for being the only Quest for Glory title without any direct influence of the character Erana, though she is referenced in a portrait at the Wizards' Institute of Technocery[^ref-1][^ref-3]. The Paladin class introduced in this game would become an important character option throughout the rest of the series[^ref-3].

- Quest for Glory Anthology (1996)[^ref-7]
