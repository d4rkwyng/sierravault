 Quest for Glory I: So You Want to Be a Hero (VGA Remake)

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview

Quest for Glory I: So You Want to Be a Hero (VGA Remake) is a 1992 enhanced version of Sierra On-Line's groundbreaking 1989 adventure/RPG hybrid originally released as *Hero's Quest: So You Want to Be a Hero*[^ref-1]. The remake features completely redrawn 256-color VGA graphics, a point-and-click interface replacing the original text parser, clay model stop-motion animation for combat sequences, and character portraits during conversations[^ref-2]. Designed by [[Lori Ann Cole]] and [[Corey Cole]], the game remains one of the most influential genre-blending titles in gaming history, successfully merging the puzzle-solving adventure gameplay Sierra was famous for with role-playing game mechanics including character classes, skill progression, and combat[^ref-34].

The VGA remake holds a unique distinction among Sierra's numerous enhanced remakes of the early 1990s: it was the only one to turn a profit[^ref-4]. Despite this success—reportedly selling more units than the original game—Sierra management had already concluded that remakes were not financially viable, making Quest for Glory I one of the last games to receive this treatment[^ref-4]. The remake cost more to produce than the original and nearly as much as developing an entirely new VGA game, contrary to Sierra's expectations that remakes would be a cheaper alternative to new productions[^ref-4].

The game introduces players to the valley of Spielburg, a Germanic-inspired fantasy setting where a novice hero must break a curse, rescue the Baron's missing children, and defeat a band of brigands[^ref-1]. Advertised as "three games in one," Quest for Glory I was the first Sierra game to allow players to select from three character classes—Fighter, Magic User, or Thief—each offering substantially different solutions to the game's puzzles and challenges[^ref-5]. This innovative design philosophy, combined with a learn-by-doing skill system and the ability to import characters into sequels, established a template that would influence both adventure games and RPGs for decades to come[^ref-6].

## Story Summary

The valley of Spielburg is under a terrible curse. Baron Stefan von Spielburg angered the fearsome ogress Baba Yaga, who responded by cursing his land and family[^ref-8]. The Baron's son Barnard was transformed into a beast, while his daughter Elsa was spirited away to lead a band of brigands terrorizing the valley[^ref-9]. With the once-prosperous region falling into ruin, the desperate Baron posted an advertisement: "Wanted: Hero. No experience necessary"[^ref-10].

The player character, a recent graduate of the Famous Adventurer's Correspondence School, arrives in the small town of Spielburg seeking to make a name for themselves[^ref-11]. The town is populated by a colorful cast of characters including beer-drinking humans, centaurs who work the fields, and the helpful Katta innkeepers Shameen and Shema[^ref-8]. Beyond the town gates lies a dangerous forest filled with goblins, sauruses, brigands, and other creatures from Germanic and Norse mythology[^ref-12].

A prophecy guides the hero's quest: "Comes a hero from the East, Free the man from in the beast, Bring the child from out the band, Drive the curser from the land"[^ref-12]. To fulfill this prophecy, the hero must locate and free Barnard from his enchantment, infiltrate the brigand fortress to rescue Elsa, and ultimately confront Baba Yaga herself to lift her curse[^ref-9]. Along the way, the hero encounters memorable characters including the wizard Erasmus and his familiar Fenrus, the healer woman in the forest, the crafty fox named Bruno, and the undead jester Yorick who delivers the famous line "Alas, poor Yorick! I know me well"[^ref-12].

The game's conclusion sees the hero celebrated as the savior of Spielburg, though the nature of that celebration varies based on class and choices made throughout the adventure[^ref-13]. Successfully completing the game allows players to export their character to Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire, continuing the hero's journey with all skills and attributes intact[^ref-14].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

The VGA remake replaces the original game's text parser with Sierra's icon-based point-and-click interface using the SCI 1.1 interpreter[^ref-7]. Players interact with the game world using standard Sierra icons for walking, looking, using items, and talking[^ref-2]. The remake also features a revamped conversation system where character portraits appear during dialogue, making interactions more immersive than the original's text-only approach[^ref-15]. Actions are easier to identify in the remake, and conversation topics are more clearly presented than in the original EGA version[^ref-16].

### Structure and Progression

Quest for Glory I takes place in a relatively compact game world centered on the town of Spielburg and its surrounding wilderness[^ref-26]. The game operates on a time-sensitive system with day and night cycles affecting gameplay—shops close at night (except the magic shop, which offers 24-hour service), different monsters appear in the forest after dark, and certain events only occur at specific times[^ref-18].

**Key Locations:**

- **Town of Spielburg:** The central hub featuring the Hero's Tale Inn, Guild Hall, Magic Shop, and various merchants[^ref-8]
- **Spielburg Castle:** Home of the Baron, accessible after proving oneself worthy[^ref-9]
- **The Forest:** A dangerous wilderness filled with monsters, treasures, and hidden locations[^ref-11]
- **Brigand Fortress:** The stronghold of the brigand leader, requiring infiltration to rescue Elsa[^ref-9]
- **Baba Yaga's Hut:** The chicken-legged dwelling of the ogress, scene of the final confrontation[^ref-9]
- **Erasmus's Tower:** Home of the wizard Erasmus, accessible only by solving the Gargoyle's riddles[^ref-12]
- **Healer's Cottage:** Where healing potions can be purchased at lower prices than in town[^ref-18]
- **Erana's Peace:** A magical garden where the hero can rest safely and restore health[^ref-11]

### Character Classes and Skills

At the start of the game, players create a character by choosing from three classes—Fighter, Magic User, or Thief—and distributing 50 points among various attributes and skills[^ref-18]. The game's innovative design allows any class to potentially solve any puzzle, provided the relevant skills are set above zero at character creation[^ref-16]. This means a Fighter can learn basic magic if points are allocated to the Magic skill, or a Magic User can develop lock-picking abilities[^ref-19].

Unlike traditional RPGs, Quest for Glory uses a learn-by-doing skill system without experience levels[^ref-14]. Skills improve through practice: fighting monsters increases combat abilities, casting spells improves magic, climbing trees raises the climbing skill, and so on[^ref-18]. Stats scale from 1 to 100 in this first game, with each subsequent title in the series raising the cap by 100[^ref-14].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Each character class approaches puzzles differently, truly making the game "three games in one"[^ref-5]:

- **Fighters** rely on brute force—breaking down doors, defeating enemies in direct combat, and using strength to solve problems[^ref-16]
- **Magic Users** employ spells like Fetch, Open, Flame Dart, and Detect Magic to bypass obstacles and defeat enemies from a distance[^ref-11]
- **Thieves** utilize stealth, lock-picking, and climbing to find alternative routes and pilfer valuable items[^ref-16]

Combat in the VGA remake features clay models for enemies and stop-motion animation, a significant visual upgrade from the original[^ref-2]. The combat system itself was made easier compared to the original version, addressing complaints about the EGA version's difficulty[^ref-20]. However, the remake introduced a new danger: running out of stamina points can now kill the hero outright, unlike the original where exhaustion merely prevented actions[^ref-1].

The game strives to minimize "walking dead" situations where the player can become stuck without hope of victory[^ref-21]. According to designer Corey Cole, "There should be very few, if any, 'walking dead' situations in this game"[^ref-21].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Quest for Glory I received widespread acclaim upon release, with reviewers particularly praising its innovative genre-blending approach. *Computer Gaming World* named the original 1989 release "Adventure Game of the Year" in 1990[^ref-1], with reviewer Scorpia calling it "a definite winner"[^ref-1]. The magazine would later rank the game #73 in their "150 Best Games of All Time" list and #15 on their list of most innovative computer games[^ref-1].

*COMPUTE!* magazine declared Quest for Glory I "a breakthrough in adventure game design" and called it "probably the most satisfying Sierra game" and "a must-buy...hard to resist"[^ref-1]. Reviewer Alfred C. Giovetti praised the VGA remake extensively, noting that "Hero's Quest is arguably the most ambitious Sierra On-Line undertaking" and describing the clay animation as producing "amazing" results[^ref-22]. He particularly lauded the rewritten text: "The totally rewritten text by the original design team of Corey and Lori Cole, who have very deep roots in the pen, pencil, and dice role-playing games, is more fun, more witty, more suspenseful, and better written than that of the original"[^ref-22].

*Macworld* named the game "Best Role-Playing Game" in their 1994 Macintosh Game Hall of Fame[^ref-23]. Reviewer Steven Levy described it as "a kinder, gentler form of role-playing game, and one particularly well suited to newcomers to the genre, especially those familiar with adventure gaming"[^ref-1]. He praised the atmosphere: "The graphics here are every bit as vivid as the plot, and the atmosphere is more like a fairy tale than your typical dungeons-and-dragons deal"[^ref-23].

*White Wolf* magazine gave both the original (Feb./March 1990) and the VGA remake (Sept./Oct. 1992) scores of 4 out of 5, with reviewer Jim Trunzo praising both versions[^ref-1].

However, not all reviews were positive. The Amiga version of Quest for Glory II (which shared technical similarities with the first game's port) received devastating criticism, with one reviewer declaring it "probably the most incompetently designed and put-together Amiga game I've seen in my life"[^ref-24]. The 8-disk release suffered from "extremely long loading times" and "frequent disk swapping," making it "nearly unplayable without a hard drive"[^ref-24].

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospectives continue to regard Quest for Glory I highly. *RPGamer* awarded the game 4/5 stars, with reviewer Tyler Willis noting that "Quest for Glory I comes recommended to any RPGamer who enjoys exploration and a good, old-fashioned graphical adventure with RPG elements"[^ref-10]. Reviewer Michael Baker called it "a piece of RPGaming history that stands the test of time" and praised the balance: "There aren't that many games out there with such a good balance of puzzles, gameplay, and writing"[^ref-25].

*Adventure Classic Gaming* gave the VGA remake 4 of 5 (Very Good), with reviewer Don Rayner noting that "This remake of an old classic retains all the elements that make the original a great game while improving on others to attract new fans"[^ref-15].

The game has maintained an enthusiastic fan following, with user ratings consistently reflecting its classic status. A modern reviewer observed: "Does the game hold up after a decade away? Absolutely it does"[^ref-14]. The game's influence has been widely acknowledged, with one analysis stating that "Quest For Glory I's influence was extremely important and it's still observed nowadays because not only it popularised the mix of genres in future video games, but it also encouraged the use of RPG elements in other genres and the use of action-adventure elements in RPGs"[^ref-26].

## Development

### Origins

The Quest for Glory series began with designers [[Lori Ann Cole]] and [[Corey Cole]], who met over a Dungeons & Dragons game at a science fiction convention[^ref-33]. Both were avid tabletop RPG enthusiasts—Corey had published "The Tower of Indomitable Circumstance" campaign book and served as Dungeon Master, while Lori was a writer, artist, and animator[^ref-34]. Together they created their own custom skill-based tabletop RPG system before pitching their video game concept to Sierra[^ref-35].

Lori Cole proposed *Hero's Quest* to Sierra when her son Michael was two years old and able to stay in day care, allowing her to work in-house at the company[^ref-36]. The original concept was far more ambitious than what eventually shipped: "I originally conceived of Quest for Glory as a fairly serious Role-playing Game with Adventure Game aspects," Lori explained[^ref-33]. However, the available art resources and engine limitations pushed the game toward a more adventure-focused, humorous approach[^ref-33].

The initial design featured multiple character races rather than classes: players would choose from thief-like gnomes, magic-wielding elves, humans, and archer centaurs[^ref-1]. The centaur race was cut first when programmer Bob Heitman pointed out that four-legged creatures are difficult to animate[^ref-33]. Eventually, the race system was replaced entirely with three classes for a single human character, though the class abilities retained echoes of the original racial concepts[^ref-33].

When Ken Williams first saw the game concept, he was skeptical: "This is a role-playing game? I don't get it. Will it appeal to either adventure gamers or role-playing gamers?"[^ref-37] However, his son Chris Williams played the game and declared "This game is awesome!"—helping convince Sierra to proceed[^ref-37].

### Production

The original *Hero's Quest* was developed with what Corey Cole described as "a relatively tiny budget, because everyone on the team made about 40% less than at their previous jobs." He estimated the cost at approximately $150,000 to $250,000[^ref-35]. Development took over a year, with up to four programmers and four artists, a musician, and a designer-director[^ref-38]. The final product contained 111,000 lines of source code, 535,000 bytes of background pictures, 1,560,000 bytes of animation, 1,980,000 bytes of program code, 375,000 characters of text messages, 314,000 bytes of music and sound effects, and over 200,000 bytes of compiled system code[^ref-38].

The game's humor emerged somewhat organically during development. "Rather than have the serious nature of the game fight with the art style, I adapted the game play to mesh with the art," Lori Cole explained[^ref-36]. Programmer Bob Fischbach was responsible for many of the first puns in the game, adding amusing responses for unhandled player input[^ref-33].

The VGA remake was produced simultaneously with Quest for Glory III: Wages of War, with Lori Cole serving as designer on both projects[^ref-1]. "They envisioned it as a faster, cheaper alternative to creating an entire new game," Corey Cole recalled. "However, it actually cost more to make than the original, and almost as much as a full game"[^ref-4].

The remake's distinctive visual style came from an innovative technical approach: clay models were sculpted for over 40 characters, then photographed at 20 frames per second in black-and-white using stop-motion animation techniques[^ref-22]. The images were then rotoscoped and colorized pixel by pixel[^ref-22]. Initially skeptical Sierra artists came around when they saw the results, which one described as "amazing"[^ref-22]. The game contains more than 6,000 lines of conversation—enough that a CD-ROM version with voice acting would require approximately 80 actors[^ref-22].

### Technical Achievements

The VGA remake utilized Sierra's SCI 1.1 interpreter, a significant upgrade from the SCI0 engine used in the original[^ref-7]. The new engine enabled 256-color VGA graphics, replacing the original's 16-color EGA palette[^ref-15]. The point-and-click interface streamlined gameplay considerably, making actions easier to execute than with the text parser[^ref-16].

The clay animation technique used for monster fights and character portraits was particularly innovative for the time. "Combat now features clay models for the enemies and stop-motion animation," contemporary documentation noted[^ref-40]. This approach gave the characters a distinctive visual personality that distinguished the remake from both its predecessor and other Sierra titles of the era.

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

The Quest for Glory series is renowned for its humor and pop culture references. The VGA remake retained many easter eggs from the original while adding new ones[^ref-2]:

**Pop Culture References:**

**Hidden Content:**
- Right-click on the scorpion on title screen for message: "Congratulations! You found the first bug in this game!"[^ref-41]
- Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd appear behind bush after winning fight (Macintosh VGA version only); shooting Elmer with a flame dart causes his hat to catch on fire[^ref-39]

- Talk twice to the bear for a Talking Bear Easter Egg[^ref-46]
- Exit and re-enter from certain areas for Conquests of the Longbow and Ecoquest Easter eggs[^ref-46]

**Development Trivia:**
- The original lead programmer quit because he didn't approve of having a Thief character in the game[^ref-37]
- Kenn Nishiuye suggested changing the subtitle from "How to Be a Hero" to "So You Want to Be a Hero"[^ref-33]
- The game was originally planned as part of a tetralogy based on seasons, representing the hero growing from youth to adult[^ref-33]
- A stat-glitch allowing infinite points redistribution exists; the Coles had no idea this bug existed and intended that 15 points would be spent during character creation[^ref-44]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Quest for Glory I achieved remarkable commercial success. The original Hero's Quest sold over 130,000 copies in its first year and more than 250,000 copies in its first few years[^ref-1]. The VGA remake reportedly sold even more units than the original[^ref-4], making it one of Sierra's best-performing titles of the era.

"Interestingly, although most of Sierra's VGA remakes were unprofitable, QG1 VGA was a notable exception," Corey Cole confirmed[^ref-4]. "I believe it actually sold more units than the original game. However, by that point, Sierra management had a picture that remakes did not make money, so ours was one of the last."

The game was frequently bundled with hardware, helping introduce the series to new audiences. The original *Hero's Quest* became one of Sierra's fastest-selling games on initial release[^ref-37].

### Critical Perspective

Quest for Glory I occupies a unique position in gaming history as one of the most successful genre hybrids ever created. "Being a genre hybrid is one of the surest ways to become a beloved game," noted one retrospective[^ref-6]. The game's influence extends far beyond the adventure genre: "Quest for Glory introduced a realism rarely found in RPGs and other adventure games even today"[^ref-5].

The series' approach to character progression—improving skills through use rather than experience points—anticipated systems that would later become common in games like The Elder Scrolls series. "Without a leveling system in place, skills improve the more they are used. In an RPG this makes sense but feels weird and out of place in an adventure game," one analyst observed, noting how the mechanic blurred genre boundaries[^ref-34].

RPG Codex summarized the series' lasting appeal: "Quest for Glory uniquely succeeded in striking the kind of balance between adventure and RPG that no other game has since attained, and that is an important part of why it remains so memorable"[^ref-35]. The ability to approach problems as a Fighter, Magic User, or Thief—and the corresponding replay value—set a template that few games have successfully replicated.

"Perhaps the best thing about the Quest For Glory series is that they exude an almost childlike joy about what video games can do," observed Rowan Kaiser in a retrospective for Engadget[^ref-6]. This sense of playful experimentation, combined with genuine RPG depth and adventure game puzzles, explains why the series continues to attract new fans decades after its release.

## See Also

The events of Quest for Glory I - So You Want to Be a Hero VGA set the stage for the hero's future adventures, including the journey to Shapeir in Quest for Glory II - Trial by Fire. Although the narrative of Trial by Fire takes place after the events of So You Want to Be a Hero, there is no direct continuation of the story, as the hero travels to a new land with its own unique challenges and characters. However, the skills and attributes gained during the quest in Spielburg are carried over into the sequel, allowing players to continue developing their character.

Mechanically, Quest for Glory I - So You Want to Be a Hero VGA laid the groundwork for the series' blend of adventure game puzzles and RPG elements, which would be further refined in subsequent entries. The introduction of character classes and skill progression systems in So You Want to Be a Hero allowed players to approach challenges from different angles, a design philosophy that would influence the development of Quest for Glory III - Wages of War. In Wages of War, the hero faces new challenges in the land of Tarna, where they must navigate the complexities of war and diplomacy, building on the foundation established in So You Want to Be a Hero.

The story of Quest for Glory I - So You Want to Be a Hero VGA also establishes key themes and characters that would be revisited throughout the series. The hero's victory over Baba Yaga and the lifting of the curse from Spielburg serve as a catalyst for their future adventures, including those in Quest for Glory III - Wages of War. As the series progresses, the hero faces new challenges and adversaries, but the core elements of exploration, puzzle-solving, and character development introduced in So You Want to Be a Hero remain central to the gameplay experience.
