# Quest for Glory: Shadows of Darkness

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview
Quest for Glory: Shadows of Darkness is a 1993 adventure game/role-playing video game hybrid, the fourth installment in the Quest for Glory series by [[Sierra On-Line]][^ref-1][^ref-2]. Designed by [[Lori Ann Cole]] and [[Corey Cole]], it was the first and only game in the series to drop the roman numerals from the title[^ref-1]. Set in Mordavia, a world described as "a mix of Slavic folklore and Lovecraftian horror," the game features darker themes while maintaining the series' trademark humor[^ref-1][^ref-3]. Released in December 1993 on floppy discs and re-released on CD-ROM in September 1994, the CD version featured full voice acting including John Rhys-Davies as the Narrator[^ref-1][^ref-4]. According to Corey Cole, the game was developed with a budget of $750,000[^ref-1]. The floppy disc version was released with inadequate testing and is considered "almost unplayable," though the CD re-release addressed many issues[^ref-1].

## Story Summary
Shadows of Darkness follows directly from the events of Quest for Glory III: Wages of War[^ref-1]. Drawn without warning from victory in Fricana, the Hero arrives without equipment or explanation in the middle of the hazardous Dark One Caves in the distant land of Mordavia, a world full of undead that is "a mix of Slavic folklore and Lovecraftian horror"[^ref-1][^ref-3].

Upon escaping from the closing cave mouth, the Hero meets a mysterious young woman named Katrina who assists him several times in his journey[^ref-1]. The Hero helps the townspeople with their problems and encounters several old foes, including the not-quite-dead Ad Avis and the ogress Baba Yaga, while making several bizarre new allies[^ref-1].

The Hero is ultimately coerced into assisting Ad Avis' Dark Master in collecting the Dark Rituals that will allow Avoozl the Dark One (an obvious Cthulhu pastiche, and most likely a reference to the Slavic deity Chernobog) to manifest in Mordavia's world[^ref-1][^ref-3]. Naturally, the Hero escapes this control and thwarts their plan[^ref-1]. During the celebration of the Hero's somewhat pyrrhic victory, the wizard Erasmus appears, summoning the Hero to the land of Silmaria[^ref-1].

> The climax sees Ad Avis destroyed in the final confrontation[^ref-1].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews
Computer Gaming World said in March 1994, "Offering a unique mix of dark mystery and light humor, Shadows of Darkness is another award winning adventure"[^ref-1]. Scorpia in April 1994 was less positive, liking the automatic combat option but disliking the "weak to obscure" puzzles and describing the end boss as "a letdown"[^ref-1]. She especially criticized the bugs, describing the game as perhaps "the sloppiest product ever released by Sierra" and requiring multiple patches[^ref-1].

Jim Trunzo reviewed the game in White Wolf #43 (May 1994), giving it a "Very Good" evaluation and stating "If you simply want some challenging fun presented in a gothic setting, try the newest Quest for Glory"[^ref-1]. The game received an ESRB rating of "Kids to Adults"[^ref-18].

### Modern Assessment
Rowan Kaizer of Engadget and Ryan Stevens of GameTrailers consider it the best entry of the entire series[^ref-1][^ref-7]. Michael Baker for RPGamer considers it "worth money even twenty years on," scoring it 4 out of 5 stars[^ref-1][^ref-8]. Adam Rosenberg of G4TV considers Shadows of Darkness "the most elaborate and well-designed" entry in the series[^ref-1]. PC Gamer's Richard Cobbett considers the game "absolutely wonderful"[^ref-1][^ref-9].

In 2011, Adventure Gamers named Shadows of Darkness the 23rd-best adventure game ever released[^ref-1]. IMDB users rate it 8.7/10, one of the highest-rated adventure games on the platform[^ref-4]. MobyGames critics average 79%[^ref-19]. The CRPG Addict gave it 47/100, a respectable score in their stringent system[^ref-20]. HowLongToBeat reports the main story takes approximately 13 hours to complete, with completionist runs taking about 24 hours[^ref-10].

## Development

### Production
Quest for Glory IV features darker themes while maintaining the humor of previous games through methods like incorporating Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre parodies[^ref-1]. The game was inspired by gothic fiction, "old horror movies and books about vampires and werewolves"[^ref-1]. Development ran late, forcing Sierra to ship the floppy version with inadequate testing[^ref-1]. The CD version released the following year was much improved[^ref-1]. The GOG digital re-release has since resolved many remaining bugs[^ref-1].

The CD-ROM version was the first game in the series to feature voice actors, including John Rhys-Davies as the Narrator (whose recording took more than three weeks), Jennifer Hale as Katrina, and Bill Farmer as Leshy[^ref-1][^ref-4].

## Legacy

Quest for Glory: Shadows of Darkness is widely considered one of the best games in the series and among the finest adventure-RPG hybrids ever made[^ref-1][^ref-7]. The game's blend of Slavic folklore and Lovecraftian horror created a unique atmosphere that set it apart from both previous entries and contemporary games[^ref-1][^ref-3]. The title change (dropping the "IV") was the only time in the series this occurred[^ref-1].

The troubled release of the floppy version, described by Scorpia as "perhaps the sloppiest product ever released by Sierra," became a cautionary tale about rushed game development[^ref-1]. Despite these issues, the game's reputation has only grown over time, with modern critics consistently ranking it among the finest adventure games ever made[^ref-1][^ref-7].

- Quest for Glory Anthology (1996)[^ref-6]
