# Quest for Glory: So You Want to Be a Hero

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 4, 2026</small>

## Overview
Quest for Glory: So You Want to Be a Hero (originally released as Hero's Quest: So You Want to Be a Hero) is a 1989 adventure game/role-playing game hybrid designed by [[Lori Ann Cole]] and [[Corey Cole]], and published by [[Sierra On-Line]] for MS-DOS[^ref-1][^ref-2]. It is the first game in the Quest for Glory series and established the series' trademark mix of graphical adventure gaming with role-playing elements such as statistic building that affect the player's ability to accomplish certain tasks[^ref-1]. The game was originally released with EGA graphics in October 1989, with a VGA remake released in July 1992[^ref-1][^ref-3]. The game was renamed from Hero's Quest to Quest for Glory in 1990 due to trademark conflicts with the HeroQuest board game[^ref-1][^ref-4]. Ports for the Amiga, Atari ST, and NEC PC-9801 were released in the early 1990s[^ref-1].

## Story Summary
In the valley barony of Spielburg, the evil ogress Baba Yaga has cursed the land and the baron who tried to drive her off[^ref-1][^ref-4]. The baron's daughter has disappeared and his son has been transformed into a bear, while the land is ravaged by monsters and brigands[^ref-1]. The Valley of Spielburg is in need of a Hero able to solve these problems[^ref-1].

The player's character is a customized adventurer, a recent graduate of the Famous Adventurer's Correspondence School, who journeys into the land seeking to become a proclaimed Hero[^ref-1][^ref-4]. The adventurer battles brigands and monsters such as kobolds, solves side quests (such as finding lost items and spell ingredients), and helps fantasy creatures such as a dryad, a hermit, and a colorful collection of furry creatures called Meeps[^ref-1]. During the quest, the character meets recurring series characters such as the wizard Erasmus and his familiar Fenrus, and first hears tales of the benevolent faery Erana[^ref-1].

In the optimal ending, the player frees the baronet Barnard von Spielburg from a powerful curse and thwarts the plans of the witch Baba Yaga[^ref-1][^ref-4]. The adventurer frees the baron's daughter, Elsa von Spielburg, from the curse which had transformed her into the brigand leader[^ref-1]. By doing so, the adventurer fulfills a prophecy, restores Spielburg Valley to prosperity, and is awarded the title of Hero[^ref-1]. After this, the Hero, along with the merchant Abdulla Doo and the innkeepers Shameen and Shema, leaves on a magic carpet for Shapeir, setting up the sequel, Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire[^ref-1].

## Gameplay

The game advertised itself as "three games in one" since it was the first Sierra game that allowed the selection of a character from three classes: Fighter, Magic User, and Thief[^ref-1][^ref-4]. The original release was an adventure game with a text parser, while the 1992 VGA remake is a point-and-click adventure game[^ref-1].

### Interface and Controls
- The original EGA version uses a text parser interface where players type commands for the character to perform[^ref-1]
- The 1992 VGA remake uses Sierra's point-and-click SCI1.1 interface[^ref-3][^ref-4]
- Players can explore all of the game at once and solve quests in any order[^ref-1]
- Character saves can be exported to carry over attributes and backstory to later installments in the series[^ref-4][^ref-5]

### Structure and Progression
- The game is set in the valley barony of Spielburg, encompassing the central town with its tavern and shops, surrounding forests, and hazardous areas like caves and swamps[^ref-4][^ref-5]
- Time passes in the game; the situation can be different between day and night, with scenery adjusted to match[^ref-1]
- The main character must eat on a regular basis and becomes tired from running and fighting, requiring rest and sleep[^ref-1]
- Skills improve through use rather than gaining levels through combat[^ref-1]

### Puzzles and Mechanics
- Character class largely determines starting equipment, how puzzles can be solved, and what quests are available[^ref-1][^ref-4]
- Class distinctions are not absolute; players can add skills to a character to complete quests related to other classes[^ref-1]
- Key quests involve liberating the goblin-captured Elsa, lifting the bear curse on Barnard, and dismantling a brigand network[^ref-5]
- Challenges emphasize class-specific strategies, such as spellcasting to bypass obstacles or lockpicking hidden paths[^ref-5]

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews
Scorpia of Computer Gaming World stated in 1990 that the game's puzzles were easy but still fun for an experienced player, and that excellent graphics and good use of humor and role-playing elements made the game "a definite winner"[^ref-1]. In 1990, Computer Gaming World named it Adventure Game of the Year, describing it as one of the few introductory games that both beginners and veterans of adventures enjoyed[^ref-1][^ref-7].

Jim Trunzo reviewed Hero's Quest in White Wolf #19 (Feb./March 1990), rating it 4 out of 5 and stating that "Hero's Quest I serves as a training ground and learning experience for the sequels. However, that's a bonus because Hero's Quest is an excellent play in its own right"[^ref-1]. Compute! in 1993 said that Hero's Quest was "probably the most satisfying" Sierra game and that Quest for Glory was "in many ways a significant improvement," praising its clay animation and stereo soundtrack[^ref-1].

The editors of Macworld gave Quest for Glory their 1994 "Best Role-Playing Game" award, with Steven Levy remarking that the game "merges classic role-playing aspects—building up a character's attributes by vanquishing enemies, all in service of a larger goal—with the more playful mood and interactivity of Sierra On-Line's King's Quest adventure-game series"[^ref-1]. The Amiga version received mixed reception, with one UK publication rating it 86%[^ref-18], while another gave it just 23% in 1991, and a German Amiga magazine rated it 64%[^ref-18].

### Modern Assessment
The game sold 130,000 copies in its first year of release[^ref-1]. In 1996, Computer Gaming World named Quest for Glory the 73rd best game ever and 15th on the magazine's list of the most innovative computer games[^ref-1][^ref-7]. Adventure Gamers rated the game 3.5/5 (Good), stating: "While actual puzzles are meagre and interspersed with RPG elements, So You Want To Be A Hero offers a fun and unique experience and never ceases to be an adventure game at its core"[^ref-8].

Adventure Classic Gaming's Don Rayner gave the game 4/5 (Very Good), praising its innovative hybrid gameplay[^ref-19]. RPGamer's Michael Baker rated it 3.5/5, while Tyler Willis gave it 4/5[^ref-20]. Richard Cobbett for PC Gamer stated that his impressions of the game are "almost all" positive, especially for the VGA remake, due to the great adventure offered and the spectacular game world[^ref-1]. HowLongToBeat reports the main story takes approximately 7 hours to complete, with completionist runs taking about 12 hours[^ref-21]. Speedrunners have achieved completion times under 5 minutes through exploit routing[^ref-22].

## Development

### Origins
The Quest for Glory series originated from the creative vision of Corey Cole, a programmer and designer with expertise in role-playing game systems, and his wife Lori Ann Cole, an artist and co-designer[^ref-5]. In August 1988, Corey submitted a five-page proposal to Sierra On-Line outlining a hybrid adventure-RPG game titled Hero's Quest: So You Want to Be a Hero[^ref-5]. The core design philosophy centered on merging Sierra's tradition of parser-driven adventure games with RPG staples such as character stats, skill progression, and tactical combat[^ref-5].

According to Corey Cole, the original Quest for Glory game cost $150,000 to make, while the VGA remake cost almost as much as a full VGA entry[^ref-1]. The development team worked to create a game that would appeal to both adventure game fans and RPG enthusiasts, implementing systems that had never been combined in this way before[^ref-5].

### Cut Content and Design Challenges
Many planned features were cut during development due to time and budget constraints, including four different races (gnome, elf, human, centaur), a female player character option, a goblin maze dungeon, and the ability for magic users to have a familiar[^ref-1][^ref-25]. The game was originally titled "Hero's Quest" but was renamed to "Quest for Glory" in 1990 due to trademark conflicts with Milton Bradley's HeroQuest board game[^ref-1][^ref-4][^ref-25]. In Corey Cole's original proposal, the game was designed as a hybrid that would give adventure game fans more interactivity and RPG fans more story[^ref-25]. The development cost was approximately $150,000 for the original EGA version[^ref-1].

### Technical Achievements
- First Sierra game to allow selection of character classes (Fighter, Magic User, Thief)[^ref-1][^ref-4]
- Innovative hybrid of adventure game puzzle-solving with RPG character progression[^ref-1][^ref-5]
- Day-night cycle affecting NPC schedules and monster encounters[^ref-1]
- Skills that improve through repeated use rather than traditional leveling[^ref-1]
- Character export system allowing saves to transfer between series entries[^ref-4][^ref-5]
- Platform releases: October 1989 (EGA DOS), 1990 (Amiga, Atari ST), July 1992 (VGA DOS), 1994 (Mac OS)[^ref-1][^ref-3]

## Legacy

The first Quest for Glory game has been credited as a genre-defining video game due to its mix of adventure and role-playing elements[^ref-1][^ref-4]. The series pioneered the hybrid genre of adventure and role-playing games, blending puzzle-solving narratives with character progression systems that allowed for class-specific solutions to challenges[^ref-5][^ref-7]. This innovative structure encouraged multiple playthroughs and influenced subsequent titles[^ref-5].

The series' emphasis on skill-based interactions over rigid puzzles set a precedent for immersive role-playing in adventure formats[^ref-5]. The Quest for Glory series was commercially successful, selling 130,000 copies in its first year of release and contributing to Sierra On-Line's strong portfolio in the adventure and RPG markets during the 1990s[^ref-1][^ref-7].

In 1996, Computer Gaming World named Quest for Glory the 73rd best game ever and 15th on the magazine's list of the most innovative computer games[^ref-1][^ref-7]. The game's influence extended beyond its commercial success, establishing design patterns for hybrid adventure-RPG games that would be emulated by later titles. The character export system, allowing players to carry their hero across multiple games, became a beloved feature that enhanced investment in the series and was ahead of its time in creating persistent cross-game narratives[^ref-4][^ref-5].
