## Overview

Apple Cider Spider is a 1983 action platformer developed by Ivan Strand and published by [[Sierra On-Line]] for the Apple II computer, requiring a minimum of 48K of RAM[^ref-1]. The game casts players as a spider navigating through the hazardous machinery of an apple cider factory, making it one of the more unusual and creative premises in early home computer gaming[^ref-2]. Before Sierra On-Line became famous for the King's Quest series and its landmark adventure games, the company produced several excellent arcade-style titles, with Apple Cider Spider standing as one of their more original offerings[^ref-3].

The game was ported to the Commodore 64 in 1984, with R.B. Stuart handling the conversion programming and music[^ref-4]. Contemporary reviewers praised the title for its inventive concept and well-animated graphics, though some noted it was better suited for younger players due to predictable enemy patterns[^ref-5]. Of all the Donkey Kong clones for home computers during this era, Apple Cider Spider has been called "by far the most creative and forward-thinking" due to its integration of logic puzzles into the platforming gameplay[^ref-6].

## Story Summary

Apple Cider Spider places the player in the role of a spider who has become trapped in an apple cider factory[^ref-2]. The spider's goal is deceptively simple: navigate through the dangerous factory machinery to reach the attic at the top of the building, where a community of other spiders awaits[^ref-2]. The journey requires ascending through three distinct screens, each representing a different stage of the cider production process.

The game's structure follows the apple cider production cycle in reverse order[^ref-2]. The spider begins at the bottling and sealing area, where finished cider is being prepared for distribution. As the spider climbs higher, it progresses through the pressing and processing areas, finally reaching the delivery zone where fresh whole apples are first brought into the factory[^ref-2]. This clever design means that while the spider struggles upward, apples are constantly being carried downward past it on conveyor belts.

Throughout the journey, the spider must avoid various hazards including the apples themselves rolling down conveyors, mechanical squeezing mechanisms, and living creatures that prey on spiders[^ref-9]. Frogs, birds, and wasps patrol the factory, each presenting unique threats to the arachnid protagonist[^ref-5]. Upon successfully completing the three screens, the spider is reunited with its fellow spiders in the attic, only for the cycle to begin again at increased difficulty[^ref-10].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Apple Cider Spider is a single-player platformer controlled via joystick on the Commodore 64 version, using Port 1[^ref-4]. The Apple II version offers customizable control keys, allowing players to configure their preferred input method[^ref-5]. The spider can move in all four cardinal directions, climb thick threads that span the factory screens, and jump over obstacles[^ref-9].

The game supports optional sound enhancement through the Mockingboard add-on card for Apple II systems[^ref-5]. Without this expansion, the game produces standard Apple II-quality beeps and buzzes that were typical of the era[^ref-12]. Players can toggle sound effects on or off according to their preferences[^ref-5].

### Structure and Progression

The game consists of three non-scrolling screens, each representing a different section of the apple cider factory[^ref-2]:

- **Screen 1 (Bottling Area):** The spider begins at the lowest level where finished cider is bottled and sealed for distribution
- **Screen 2 (Processing Area):** The middle section where apples are pressed and processed into cider
- **Screen 3 (Apple Delivery):** The top section where fresh whole apples arrive at the factory

Due to the placement of platforms, ropes, and obstacles, each screen has one safe path through that players must discover[^ref-10]. Sometimes the route is clear, but trial and error is often necessary to determine the correct sequence of movements[^ref-10]. After completing all three screens, the game repeats at a higher difficulty level[^ref-10].

The game features seven difficulty levels, numbered 0 through 6[^ref-12]. Level 0 is designated as the "Teddy Bear" level, designed specifically for young children or beginners[^ref-5]. Players can select their starting difficulty and even change levels during gameplay[^ref-5].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Unlike typical platformers of the era, Apple Cider Spider incorporates logic puzzle elements into its gameplay[^ref-6]. The factory machinery acts as interactive puzzle components, forcing players to think carefully about which path to take through the multiple alternate routes available[^ref-6]. Moving belts carry objects through the factory, and players must time their movements to avoid being swept away or crushed[^ref-5].

The game features drop-lines that the spider can use to descend between platforms, adding a vertical dimension to navigation[^ref-5]. Conveyor belts move at varying speeds, and the spider must account for their direction when planning routes. The mechanical squeezing mechanisms present timing-based obstacles that require precise movement to bypass safely[^ref-9].

A scoring system rewards players for progress and skill, with a Hall of Fame tracking the top ten scores[^ref-5]. The game includes a score wiping facility for those who wish to reset the leaderboard[^ref-5].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Apple User magazine reviewed Apple Cider Spider in their January 1984 issue, with Cliff McKnight awarding the game 65%[^ref-5]. McKnight praised the title, noting "any new game from Sierra On-Line is worth investigating and Apple Cider Spider is well written and well animated"[^ref-5]. However, he characterized it as "a game for children really, easily mastered because the predators move in predictable patterns"[^ref-5]. He elaborated: "I think it is most a game for children, because they didn't seem to tire of it at all. I enjoyed it until I had mastered it, and if it had more screens or levels and some randomness, I'd be playing it still"[^ref-5].

The game received mixed responses from the Commodore 64 community. One reviewer at C64-Wiki noted it was "playable for my taste, but not really good, on the one hand too fiddly and on the other hand too short to rate above average"[^ref-12]. Another C64-Wiki reviewer was more positive: "A cute little game, which has the lot, if you want to make it to the attic of the cider factory in the highest level"[^ref-12]. This same reviewer praised the era's creativity: "I like these inventive Hi-Res games of the early 80s! One realizes, that the programmers could not bring the new computer to its limitations yet, but they had a lot of funny ideas as a chance to prevail"[^ref-12].

### Modern Assessment

Modern players have offered varied perspectives on Apple Cider Spider. One Lemon64 user recalled: "Enjoyed this unique game on its release but by god was it hard"[^ref-4]. Another challenged this assessment: "This was the first video game that I ever managed to beat. I'm surprised everyone found it so hard!"[^ref-4]. My Abandonware users have praised the game, with one noting: "Very decent game. I still love to watch how the factory works. Should have been played by more people"[^ref-13]. Another commented: "Used to laugh about the name of this game. It's a pretty decent platformer and had a nice challenge that wasn't based on terrible controls"[^ref-13].

The game has been characterized as a notable Donkey Kong-style platformer: "Of all the Donkey Kong clones for the home computer this one is by far the most creative and forward-thinking. Your spider needs to travel through various machinery which also act as logic puzzles, thus forcing you to think carefully about which path you're going to take (of which there are many alternate ones!). It is short and sweet, and easily beatable in 15 minutes"[^ref-6].

## Development

### Origins

Apple Cider Spider was created by Ivan Strand and published by Sierra On-Line during the company's early period of arcade-style game production[^ref-1]. Before Sierra became synonymous with adventure games through the King's Quest series, they produced numerous action titles, many of which were clones of popular arcade games[^ref-3]. Apple Cider Spider stood out as one of their more original concepts, featuring a unique premise that one reviewer described as "an almost minteresque idea"[^ref-12].

The choice of a spider as protagonist was noted as unusual for the time. One reviewer remarked: "Poor, but very funny! Never seen a game with a spider as main character!"[^ref-4]. The game's title plays on the double meaning of "spider" and "cider," creating a memorable name that some players found amusing[^ref-13].

### Production

The original Apple II version was programmed entirely in machine language by Ivan Strand[^ref-7]. The game required 48K of RAM, which was standard for Apple II software of the period[^ref-1]. The Commodore 64 port, released in 1984, was developed by R.B. Stuart (also known as Rich & Rich Enterprises or Syndein Systems), who handled both the coding and music adaptation[^ref-4][^ref-14].

The game was released under Sierra's SierraVision label, which was used for their arcade-style action games as distinct from their adventure game line[^ref-7]. The C64 version was distributed on both disk and tape formats, with PAL compatibility for European markets[^ref-4][^ref-15].

### Technical Issues

The Commodore 64 version has some documented issues with different cracked releases. The version released by German Cracking Service has a broken highscore saver[^ref-12]. The Desperado (ASS) version from Gamebase64 has been verified to work correctly with no mistakes found and proper highscore saving functionality[^ref-12].

Some users noted the controls as "slightly fiddly" and the gameplay "perhaps somewhat unfair here and there"[^ref-4]. The game's short length (completable in approximately 15 minutes) was seen as both a positive for casual play and a negative for those seeking longer experiences[^ref-6][^ref-14].

### Easter Eggs and Trivia

- **Spider Design:** One player observed that "the spider looks a lot like the secret 'owl' printed on a $1 bill"[^ref-4]
- **Spider Appearance:** Some players noted the spider character "looks more like an octopus" than an actual spider[^ref-3]
- **Educational Element:** The game provides insight into the apple cider making process, with one reviewer claiming "anyone who has completed its three levels will know how to make apple cider by themselves"[^ref-3]
- **Unique Concept:** Described as "which game idea is more obvious than the spider in the apple cider factory" with ironic appreciation for its unusual premise[^ref-12]
- **End Sequence:** The ending sequence that reunites the spider with others in the attic only plays once, after which the game simply returns to level one at higher difficulty[^ref-3]

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Apple Cider Spider was one of numerous arcade-style games Sierra On-Line produced in the early 1980s before shifting focus to their more famous adventure game line[^ref-3]. While not a major commercial success compared to Sierra's later titles, the game has maintained a small but dedicated following among retro gaming enthusiasts. The game appeared on GOG.com's wishlist (dreamlist) as a requested title for re-release, indicating continued interest from collectors[^ref-17].

The game has been preserved through various abandonware archives and emulation projects. It is playable through Virtual Apple for Apple II emulation[^ref-18] and is included in Commodore 64 game collections[^ref-15]. GameFAQs users rated the game's length at approximately 2 hours for full completion and its difficulty as "Just Right"[^ref-14].

### Collections

Apple Cider Spider has not appeared in official Sierra compilation releases, remaining one of the company's more obscure early titles. However, it is preserved in various fan-maintained archives and emulation collections, including the Internet Archive's software library[^ref-1][^ref-19].

### Fan Projects

The game has been preserved through multiple community efforts. The "woz-a-day" project cracked and preserved the Apple II disk image in 2018[^ref-1]. Various Commodore 64 preservation groups have maintained playable versions, though as noted, some cracked versions have issues with the highscore saving feature[^ref-12].

### Critical Perspective

Apple Cider Spider represents an interesting footnote in Sierra On-Line's history, showcasing the company's range before they became synonymous with graphic adventure games. While King's Quest would launch in 1984 and define Sierra's future direction, titles like Apple Cider Spider demonstrate the experimental nature of the early home computer game market[^ref-3].

The game's creative premise—controlling a spider through cider factory machinery—was unusual enough to merit comment from nearly every reviewer who encountered it[^ref-4][^ref-12]. Its integration of puzzle-solving elements into platforming gameplay was ahead of its time, even if the brief length (only three screens) limited its lasting appeal[^ref-6]. The game stands as an example of the inventive hi-res games of the early 1980s, when programmers were still discovering what home computers could achieve and compensated for technical limitations with creative concepts[^ref-12].
