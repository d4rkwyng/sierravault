## Overview

Wallwar is an action game developed by Peter Oliphant and published by Sierra On-Line for the Atari 8-bit computer systems in 1983[^ref-1][^ref-1]. Originally titled "Force Fields" during development[^ref-3], the game was released under Sierra's short-lived SierraVision label[^ref-3], which was used for a brief period to differentiate certain arcade-style titles from Sierra's adventure game catalog.

The game features competitive head-to-head gameplay where players must break through a kinetic brick wall positioned in the center of the screen while simultaneously attempting to destroy their opponent's force field[^ref-3]. Wallwar was noted for being "visually impressive with a lot of things going on at once"[^ref-3], borrowing elements from various existing games to create its unique gameplay experience[^ref-3]. The game supports both single-player and two-player modes[^ref-1][^ref-5][^ref-6].

Despite its technical achievements, Wallwar failed to achieve commercial success, selling "only a very limited number of copies"[^ref-3]. The game represents an interesting footnote in Sierra's history, documenting the company's brief foray into arcade-style action games during the early 1980s and the turbulent circumstances surrounding its development.

## Story Summary

As an arcade-style action game from the early 1980s, Wallwar does not feature a traditional narrative story[^ref-1]. The game is purely focused on competitive gameplay mechanics rather than storytelling elements.

The conceptual premise involves two opposing forces separated by a central barrier, each attempting to breach the other's defenses[^ref-3]. Players control their respective sides of the playfield, working to penetrate the kinetic brick wall that divides the screen while protecting their own force field from destruction[^ref-3].

The game's design philosophy prioritized action and visual spectacle over narrative depth, which was typical of arcade-influenced titles of this era[^ref-3]. The focus remained squarely on fast-paced, competitive gameplay that challenged players' reflexes and strategic thinking.

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Wallwar supports multiple input methods, allowing players to use either a joystick or keyboard for control[^ref-1]. The joystick control scheme was standard for Atari 8-bit action games of the period, providing intuitive and responsive input for the fast-paced gameplay[^ref-1].

The game accommodates 1-2 players[^ref-1], with the two-player mode serving as the primary competitive experience. In single-player mode, the computer controls the opposing force field[^ref-1].

### Structure and Progression

The gameplay centers around a divided playfield with a kinetic brick wall positioned in the middle of the screen[^ref-3]. The core objective requires players to:

- **Offensive Goal:** Break through the center wall to access the opponent's side[^ref-3]
- **Defensive Goal:** Protect your own force field from destruction[^ref-3]
- **Victory Condition:** Successfully destroy the opponent's force field[^ref-3]

### Puzzles and Mechanics

Rather than puzzles, Wallwar features action-oriented mechanics that borrowed elements from multiple existing game genres[^ref-3]. The kinetic brick wall in the center serves as both obstacle and opportunity, requiring players to strategically break through while managing their defenses[^ref-3].

The game was praised for having "a lot of things going on at once"[^ref-3], suggesting multiple simultaneous gameplay elements that demanded player attention and quick reflexes. The blend of offensive and defensive mechanics created a dynamic competitive experience that set it apart from simpler single-objective games of the era[^ref-3].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

Documentation of contemporary reviews for Wallwar is extremely limited in available sources. The game's commercial failure meant it received minimal coverage in gaming publications of the period[^ref-3].

Ernst Krogtoft of Retro365 noted that "Neither WallWar nor Mr. Cool became commercial success stories"[^ref-3], indicating that the game struggled to find an audience despite its technical merits[^ref-3].

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospective coverage of Wallwar remains sparse due to the game's obscurity. The Retro365 blog provided one of the few detailed retrospective analyses, describing the game as "visually impressive"[^ref-3] while acknowledging its commercial failure[^ref-3].

**Aggregate Scores:**
- **MobyGames:** No user rating available[^ref-1]

The game's limited commercial distribution means that few copies survived, making it a collector's item and contributing to its obscurity in gaming history[^ref-3][^ref-4]. Various preservation projects have worked to document and archive Atari 8-bit software from this era[^ref-5][^ref-8].

## Development

### Origins

Wallwar began development under the working title "Force Fields"[^ref-3]. The game was created by Peter Oliphant, who developed it during his evenings and nights while still employed at Mattel[^ref-3]. Oliphant originally prototyped the game on MOS Technology's 6502 8-bit microprocessor[^ref-3], which was the processor architecture used in Atari 8-bit computers.

The development circumstances were unusual, as Oliphant worked on the project entirely in his personal time, separate from his duties at Mattel[^ref-3]. This independent development approach would later create significant legal complications for the young developer[^ref-3].

### Production

When Peter Oliphant approached Ken Williams at Sierra On-Line with his completed prototype, Williams offered $16,000 for the game[^ref-3]. This sum was three times what Oliphant had hoped to receive for his work[^ref-3], demonstrating Williams' confidence in the project's potential.

After accepting the offer, Oliphant quit his position at Mattel to focus on completing the game[^ref-3]. Ken Williams gave him two months to finish Wallwar for commercial release[^ref-3].

However, Mattel attempted to claim ownership of the game despite Oliphant developing it entirely on his own time[^ref-3]. In a dramatic confrontation, Mattel subpoenaed Oliphant at his own going-away party from the company[^ref-3]. This legal challenge represented the kind of intellectual property disputes that became increasingly common in the early game industry as developers moved between companies.

### Technical Achievements

Wallwar was noted for its visual complexity, with reviewers commenting on the impressive amount of on-screen activity[^ref-3]. The kinetic brick wall mechanic demonstrated sophisticated collision detection and physics for its era[^ref-3].

The game's development on the 6502 microprocessor architecture[^ref-3] allowed Oliphant to optimize performance for the Atari 8-bit platform's specific capabilities[^ref-1].

### Multiple Endings

As an action game, Wallwar does not feature multiple endings. Gameplay sessions conclude when one player successfully destroys the opponent's force field[^ref-3].

## Voice Cast

Wallwar does not feature voice acting, which was standard for Atari 8-bit games of this era[^ref-1].

## Legacy

### Sales and Commercial Impact

Wallwar was a commercial disappointment, selling "only a very limited number of copies"[^ref-3]. Ernst Krogtoft noted that "Neither WallWar nor Mr. Cool became commercial success stories"[^ref-3], referring to the two games Peter Oliphant developed for Sierra On-Line.

The game's poor sales contributed to its current obscurity, with few copies remaining in circulation[^ref-3]. This commercial failure was despite Sierra's confidence in the project, as evidenced by Ken Williams' generous offer of $16,000 for the game rights[^ref-3].

### Collections

Wallwar has not been included in any official Sierra compilation releases[^ref-1]. The game remains available primarily through digital preservation efforts[^ref-4].

### Fan Projects

No significant fan remake or modification projects for Wallwar have been documented.

### Related Publications

No official hint book, strategy guide, or related publications were produced for Wallwar due to its limited commercial distribution[^ref-3].

**Primary Documentation Sources:**
- **Matt Chat Interview:** Peter Oliphant provided first-hand accounts of the game's development in a video interview, which served as the primary source for the Retro365 retrospective article[^ref-3]

### Critical Perspective

Wallwar occupies a curious position in Sierra's history as one of the company's attempts to diversify beyond adventure games in the early 1980s[^ref-3]. The game's release under the SierraVision label suggests Sierra was experimenting with brand differentiation to distinguish arcade-style games from their narrative-driven adventure titles[^ref-3].

The development story behind Wallwar is perhaps more significant than the game itself, illustrating the volatile nature of the early game industry. Peter Oliphant's experience—developing games as a "moonlighting" project, facing legal challenges from his employer, and ultimately creating a commercial failure despite technical innovation—reflects the precarious position of game developers in the pre-established industry era[^ref-3]. The game serves as a reminder that Sierra, while best known for adventure games, explored multiple genres during its formative years, with varying degrees of success[^ref-3].
