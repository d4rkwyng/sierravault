## Overview

Inca is a unique science fiction adventure game that combines multiple gameplay styles into one ambitious experience. Originally developed by French studio Coktel Vision in 1992[^ref-1] and published by Sierra On-Line[^ref-2], the game presents an anachronistic blend of Incan mythology and space opera elements. The player takes on the role of El Dorado, a time-traveling space pilot charged with recovering the treasure of the Incas and fulfilling an ancient prophecy to restore the Incan empire[^ref-3].

What makes Inca particularly memorable is its "schizophrenic conception"[^ref-4] that combines adventure gameplay with space combat, puzzle-solving, and first-person exploration sequences. As one retrospective noted, "Inca has been famous for combining many different genres to form a certain story-line"[^ref-5]. The game's premise asks the provocative historical question: "How can it be that only a handful of ill equipped conquistadors, some 170-200 men, were able to defeat a well trained army of tens of thousands of soldiers?"[^ref-6] The game's answer involves spacecraft battles between Incas and Spanish conquistadors in an alternate timeline where "Incans also had access to space crafts, and routinely ventured into the sky to do battle with the magnificent floating galleons of the Spanish Armada"[^ref-7].

## Story Summary

The game's narrative centers around the prophecy of Huayna Capac, the last great Inca emperor, who foretells the coming of El Dorado - "a mythical and legendary character chosen to restore the Inca Empire"[^ref-10]. Players control this chosen warrior who must embark on a mission through time and space, as "mysterious powers, dormant for 500 years, wait to be unleashed"[^ref-11]. The quest involves traveling to South America during the time of the European invasion to find the legendary Inca treasure[^ref-12].

The player's goal is to unite three sacred jewels representing Time, Matter, and Energy[^ref-6] while piloting a spacecraft called the Tumi - named after the ceremonial Incan knife. As the game manual explains: "You are the chosen one, it is up to you to fulfill the prophecy. The spirit of Huayna Capac will guide you on your quest as you attempt to rekindle Inti, the sun and bring about the rebirth of the mighty Incan empire"[^ref-6]. The antagonist is the Spanish conquistador Aguirre, leading the colonial forces against the indigenous empire[^ref-13].

## Gameplay

### Interface and Controls

Inca requires both mouse and keyboard input, with a minimum memory requirement of 558,680 bytes free[^ref-6]. The game supports various sound formats including AdLib, OPL2, and Sound Blaster[^ref-14]. Players navigate through multiple gameplay perspectives, from first-person space combat to traditional adventure game puzzle-solving interfaces[^ref-15].

### Structure and Progression

The game is divided into 16 sections in the CD version, compared to 12 in the original floppy disk release[^ref-9]. Rather than traditional save games, Inca uses a password system with unique save codes for each section[^ref-4]. Players can access cheat codes by pressing <SHIFT><CTRL><ALT> I N C A to maximize lives and power[^ref-16], and can skip the first 12 game sections by using F1 on the restore game screen[^ref-17].

### Puzzles and Mechanics

The gameplay combines "fighting space simulator, shooting, maze exploration, and puzzle solving"[^ref-5]. Players must master space combat sequences while piloting the Tumi spacecraft, which "harnesses the power of the sun and uses spatiotemporal energy weapons to blast the enemies of the renaissance out of your space time continuum"[^ref-18]. One notable sequence is described as a "homage to Star Wars Death Star trench run"[^ref-4]. The game also includes traditional adventure elements like inventory management and dialogue sequences with digitized actors[^ref-4].

## Reception

### Contemporary Reviews

| Publication | Score | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Power Unlimited | 90/100 | "An example of how the CD-I player can produce a good game"[^ref-9] |
| CD-i magazine | 85% | Praised graphics and sound[^ref-9] |
| Computer Gaming World | - | "Failed to achieve its full potential"[^ref-9] |
| Next Generation | 1/5 | Called the CD-i conversion "painful"[^ref-19] |
| GamePro | - | "Graphics are sometimes mesmerizing, sometimes mundane"[^ref-19] |

Contemporary critics were divided on the game's ambitious scope. While some praised its technical presentation, Computer Gaming World noted that it "comes across as a loosely strung together series of action sequences, mazes and puzzles"[^ref-9]. GamePro's 1994 review observed that "the controls bring Inca's high-flying storyline and effects down to earth"[^ref-19].

### Modern Assessment

Modern retrospective reviews have been more appreciative of the game's unusual nature. MobyGames critics gave it a score of 69%[^ref-20], while MyAbandonware users rated it 4.71/5[^ref-21]. One player review described it as "the weirdest game that I have played so far"[^ref-20], with another noting: "If you can find a copy and a computer capable of playing it, it's worth the experience simply for the sheer oddness of the game"[^ref-20].

The Collection Chamber's retrospective noted that "Everything about these games are contradictory. The action elements are at odds with the adventuring. The science-fiction is jarringly anachronistic to the historical setting. Yet despite this and the unintentionally hilarious art and design choices, they are games that I highly recommend"[^ref-4].

## Development

### Origins

Inca was developed by Coktel Vision, a Paris-based developer known for adventure games with a distinctly European sensibility[^ref-22]. The game represents a collaboration between the Coktel team and Sierra's development resources following Sierra's acquisition of Coktel Vision in 1993[^ref-23]. Designer Pierre Gilhodes, known for his work on the Gobliiins series, brought his signature surreal humor to the project[^ref-8].

### Production

The game featured music composed by Charles Callet and G. Douieb[^ref-6][^ref-24], with J.M. Marrier providing vocals on the song "Inca People"[^ref-25]. The voice cast included Ivan Bond as Aguirre, Yasmine Moïra as the young Aclla, and Alberto Quintanilla as Inca Huayna Capac[^ref-20]. The soundtrack received particular praise, with one player noting they "warmly remember the soundtrack"[^ref-26].

The CD-ROM version, released in 1993, featured enhanced content including "additional cutscenes, full voiceover, and updated soundtrack"[^ref-9] compared to the original floppy disk version. The enhanced version also included full-motion video sequences using digitized actors[^ref-4].

### Technical Achievements

Inca was notable for its technical presentation, featuring "full motion video"[^ref-27] and digitized graphics that were "pretty good for the early 90s"[^ref-4]. The game supported VGA graphics and required an Intel 286 processor with 640 kB of RAM[^ref-28]. The space combat sequences utilized "fully 3D space combat" with rotating views controlled by mouse input[^ref-29].

## Legacy

Inca spawned a sequel, Inca II: Wiracocha (also known as Inca II: Nations of Immortality), released in 1993[^ref-30]. The series became part of Sierra's catalog when they acquired Coktel Vision, as noted: "Sierra's 1993 acquisition of Coktel Vision, a Paris-based developer and publisher of education and entertainment software, added titles such as Goblins and the Inca series to the Sierra family of products"[^ref-23].

Despite its mixed critical reception, the game has maintained interest among retro gaming enthusiasts. As one modern assessment noted: "I'm honestly surprised it doesn't have a cult following; it's the sort of game that lovers of the bizarre would flock to"[^ref-20]. The game's unique blend of genres and anachronistic premise has made it a curiosity piece in adventure gaming history.

The rights to the Inca series, along with other Coktel Vision properties, eventually passed to Activision through Sierra's various acquisitions[^ref-31]. While not currently available on modern digital platforms like GOG[^ref-31], the games remain accessible through preservation sites and abandonware communities[^ref-32].
