## Digital Storefronts

### GOG.com (Recommended for Classics)

The best option for classic Sierra adventures. GOG packages include manuals, hint books, and pre-configured DOSBox/ScummVM setups. All purchases are DRM-free.

**Collections:**
- [King's Quest 1+2+3](https://www.gog.com/game/kings_quest_1_2_3), [4+5+6](https://www.gog.com/game/kings_quest_4_5_6), and [7+8](https://www.gog.com/game/kings_quest_7_8) — AGI originals only; **missing KQ1 SCI remake (1990)**
- [Space Quest 1+2+3](https://www.gog.com/game/space_quest_1_2_3) and [4+5+6](https://www.gog.com/game/space_quest_4_5_6) — EGA/SCI versions; **missing SQ1 VGA remake (1991)**
- [Leisure Suit Larry Collection](https://www.gog.com/game/leisure_suit_larry) — LSL1–7 plus remakes
- [Quest for Glory Collection](https://www.gog.com/game/quest_for_glory) — QFG1–5 including VGA remake
- [Police Quest Collection](https://www.gog.com/game/police_quest_1_2_3_4) — PQ1–4 plus SWAT manuals
- [Gabriel Knight trilogy](https://www.gog.com/game/gabriel_knight_sins_of_the_fathers) — All three games available separately or bundled

**Individual Titles:** Phantasmagoria 1–2, Torin's Passage, Shivers, RAMA, Betrayal at Krondor, Arcanum, Caesar III, Pharaoh, Zeus, The Incredible Machine, Red Baron, Aces series, and more.

**Why GOG over Steam:** GOG ensures old games work on modern systems before selling them. Steam often sells games as-is from the publisher, which may require additional patching.

### Steam

Activision's Sierra catalog mirrors most GOG offerings, with one key advantage: VGA remakes.

**Collections:**
- [King's Quest Collection](https://store.steampowered.com/app/10100/Kings_Quest_Collection/) — KQ1–7 with both AGI originals and SCI remake
- [Space Quest Collection](https://store.steampowered.com/app/10110/Space_Quest_Collection/) — SQ1–6 with both EGA original and VGA remake
- [Quest for Glory 1-5](https://store.steampowered.com/app/502750/Quest_for_Glory_15/) — All five games plus QFG1 VGA remake
- [Police Quest Collection](https://store.steampowered.com/app/494740/Police_Quest_Collection/) — PQ1–4 with VGA remake of PQ1
- [Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/495700/Gabriel_Knight_Sins_of_the_Father/) — Original 1993 version; [20th Anniversary Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/262000/Gabriel_Knight_Sins_of_the_Fathers_20th_Anniversary_Edition/) (2014 remake) also available; [GK2: The Beast Within](https://store.steampowered.com/app/496760/The_Beast_Within_A_Gabriel_Knight_Mystery/) and [GK3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/497360/Gabriel_Knight_3_Blood_of_the_Sacred_Blood_of_the_Damned/) sold separately
- [Phantasmagoria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/501990/Phantasmagoria/) and [Phantasmagoria 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/501970/Phantasmagoria_2_A_Puzzle_of_Flesh/)
- **Leisure Suit Larry classics** — Delisted from Steam; use GOG for LSL1–7

**Advantages over GOG:**
- **Includes VGA remakes** — King's Quest I SCI (1990) and Space Quest I VGA (1991) are Steam-exclusive
- After 2016 updates, collections include both original and remake versions

**Caveats:**
- May require community patches for full functionality
- Check Steam community guides for fixes (widescreen patches, bug fixes)

**Modern titles on Steam:** SpaceVenture, Colossal Cave 3D Adventure, Hero-U, Gray Matter, Cognition, Leisure Suit Larry: Wet Dreams series, and other alumni projects.

### Xbox Game Pass (Retro Classics)

**New in 2025:** Microsoft launched the Retro Classics collection on Game Pass in May 2025, powered by Antstream Arcade. This brings emulated Sierra games to Xbox and PC subscribers.

**Sierra games added so far:**
- Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers
- Conquests of Camelot: The Search for the Grail
- Police Quest 2: The Vengeance
- Codename: ICEMAN
- Rise of the Dragon
- Caesar

The library expands monthly with ~4 new titles. Microsoft now owns Sierra IP through the Activision Blizzard acquisition, so expect more additions throughout 2026.

## Physical Media & Collecting

### eBay & Resale Markets

Active marketplace for Sierra big box games. Sought-after items include:
- **King's Quest series** — Early releases with cloth maps and manuals
- **Gabriel Knight** — Triangular CD-ROM box with comic prequel is highly collectible
- **Space Quest 2** — Complete boxes include a comic bridging SQ1 and SQ2
- **Phantasmagoria** — 7-disc original release

**Tips:**
- Inspect discs for rot (common on 1990s CDs)
- Confirm CD keys aren't already registered to Steam/Battle.net
- Factory-sealed copies command significant premiums
- "Sierra Originals" budget re-releases are more affordable but less collectible

### Retail Compilations

- **Sierra 15th/20th Anniversary Collections** — Multi-disc Windows bundles with printed materials; common on eBay
- **Vivendi "Best Sellers" line** — Late-90s jewel cases; often need patches from SierraHelp
- **UK "Sold Out Software" releases** — Budget versions of Pharaoh, Zeus, Lords of the Realm II

## Bundles & Sales

### GOG Sales
Wait for seasonal sales—GOG frequently bundles Sierra collections at 50–75% off. The entire catalog often goes on sale during Summer and Winter events.

### Humble Bundle
The last Sierra-specific bundle was **Humble Sierra the 3rd** in June 2020 (Gabriel Knight, Phantasmagoria, Arcanum, Quest for Glory, etc.). No recent Sierra bundles as of January 2026, but individual titles occasionally appear in Humble Choice.

### Steam Sales
Activision discounts Sierra collections during major sales. The 2025 Black Friday sale offered up to 53% off.

## Preservation Tips

1. **Back up installers** — Licensing disputes have delisted titles before (SWAT 3, Betrayal at Krondor temporarily)
2. **Archive GOG offline installers** — They're DRM-free and yours to keep
3. **Verify ownership before seeking alternatives** — Community patches and ScummVM require legal game data
4. **Use recommended wrappers** — DOSBox, ScummVM, dgVoodoo2, and nGlide enhance compatibility

## Regional Restrictions

Some titles have purchase/activation restrictions:
- **China:** Phantasmagoria 1–2, Police Quest Collection, Quest for Glory Collection blocked
