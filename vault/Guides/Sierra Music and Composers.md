# Sierra Music and Composers

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 31, 2026</small>

Sierra On-Line's approach to video game music helped legitimize the medium as an artistic form. From the bleeps and bloops of early PC speakers to full orchestral recordings, Sierra's audio evolution paralleled—and often led—the industry's technological advancement.

## Overview: The Sound of Adventure

Sierra's music department, under the leadership of [[Mark Seibert]], became one of the most influential game audio teams of the 1980s and 1990s. The company invested heavily in sound technology partnerships and hired talented composers who created memorable themes that players still recall decades later.

As [[Ken Allen]] recalled about joining Sierra in 1989: "I became a musician at age 10, learning to play the French Horn because my school was 'all out of trumpets,' and later pursued a college education in film composition at UCLA."[^ref-1] His entry into the industry came through a classified ad in the Fresno Bee seeking musicians and composers for adventure games—the beginning of a career that would see him compose for approximately 30 games.[^ref-1]

## Technology Progression

### PC Speaker Era (1980–1987)

Early Sierra games relied entirely on the PC's internal speaker, which could only produce single-voice square waves. Composers worked within severe constraints, using pseudo-layering and arpeggios to simulate multiple voices simultaneously.

The [[2003 - Space Quest 0 - Replicated\|Space Quest 0]] developers noted that PC Speaker beeps "is not a bug, this is the way the games were made." Some games supported PCjr/Tandy 3-voice music with a white noise channel, offering slight improvements for those with the hardware.

### FM Synthesis: AdLib and Sound Blaster (1987–1989)

The AdLib Music Synthesizer Card ($245) brought FM synthesis to PC gaming in 1987, enabling more complex compositions.[^ref-2] Games like Deathtrack notably used "AdLib music only, not Sound Blaster."

### The Roland MT-32 Revolution (1988–1993)

The partnership between Sierra and Roland transformed PC game audio. Ken Williams secured this relationship after meeting a Roland representative at a trade show, enabling support for the MT-32 synthesizer's 32 simultaneous voices.[^ref-3]

[[1988 - King's Quest IV - The Perils of Rosella\|King's Quest IV]] (1988) became the landmark title for this technology. Emmy-nominated composer William Goldstein created over 75 pieces of original music totaling forty minutes, with each of the 35 characters receiving their own theme.[^ref-3][^ref-4] Sierra's marketing asked: "Can a Computer Game Make a Person Cry?"[^ref-3]

Ken Allen explained the technical challenges: "There were really only two types of sound cards when I started at Sierra, those that used FM synthesis (the kind used in the Yamaha DX7) and those that used Additive synthesis from Roland," requiring composers to adapt each song to play on five different playback devices.[^ref-5]

**Notable MT-32 soundtracks:**
- [[1988 - King's Quest IV - The Perils of Rosella\|King's Quest IV]] – William Goldstein
- [[1988 - Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (in Several Wrong Places)\|Leisure Suit Larry II]] – [[Al Lowe]]
- [[1990 - King's Quest V - Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder\|King's Quest V]] – [[Mark Seibert]], [[Ken Allen]]
- [[1991 - Space Quest I - Roger Wilco in the Sarien Encounter\|Space Quest I VGA]] – [[Ken Allen]]
- [[1988 - Silpheed\|Silpheed]] – One reviewer declared: "If you're lucky enough to own an MT-32, your starship-blasting experience will be augmented by some of the most catchy music ever to be heard in a PC action game."

### General MIDI and Sound Canvas (1993–1996)

Sierra transitioned to General MIDI compatibility with Roland Sound Canvas (SC-55) support, offering broader accessibility while maintaining quality. Games like [[1993 - Freddy Pharkas - Frontier Pharmacist\|Freddy Pharkas]] featured enhanced audio support for Roland SC-55 General MIDI and compatibility with SB32/AWE32/64 sound cards.

### CD Audio Era (1995–1999)

The move to CD-ROM enabled pre-recorded audio, fundamentally changing composition possibilities. [[Al Lowe]] celebrated this transition: "And then with Larry 7, we replaced MIDI music with real musicians. For me, as a musician, that was a wonderful treat. To be able to actually hire live musicians, set them up in a studio, record the soundtrack, and then play it back directly in the game was a big kick."[^ref-6]

Ken Allen was instrumental in Sierra's adoption of "redbook audio" in CD-ROM games, with [[1987 - Mixed-Up Mother Goose\|Mixed-Up Mother Goose]] being what he believed was the first game to use this technology.[^ref-5]

For [[1995 - Phantasmagoria\|Phantasmagoria]], Mark Seibert and Jay Usher created a musical score that was recorded live with real instruments mixed with synthesized sounds—a significant departure from the purely electronic scores common at the time.[^ref-7] The music ranged from rock and roll to orchestral arrangements.[^ref-8]

## Key Composers

### Mark Seibert – Music Director (1987–2001)

[[Mark Seibert]] served as Sierra's music director for fifteen years, overseeing the audio direction for virtually every major release.[^ref-9] Born in 1960 in California, Seibert joined Sierra in 1987 after performing guitar and vocals for the Christian band Omega Sunrise (1979–1986).[^ref-10]

**Career highlights:**
- Accumulated 159 credits across 54 games[^ref-11]
- Promoted to producer in 1992, expanding beyond music to all aspects of production[^ref-9]
- Composed "Girl in the Tower" for [[1992 - King's Quest VI - Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow\|King's Quest VI]], one of the most recognized pieces of video game music from the era[^ref-12]

### Ken Allen (1989–1991)

[[Ken Allen]] began his career at Sierra on April 7, 1989, after seeing a classified ad that he initially thought "was no way a real full time job because it seemed too good to be true."[^ref-5] His work at Sierra coincided with what many consider the true golden age of adventure gaming.[^ref-13]

**Technical contributions:**
- Created sound banks for various sound cards using his synthesizer expertise
- Built a synthesizer from a kit in 1978—"a smaller version of the Moog synthesizer depicted on the cover of Switched on Bach"[^ref-5]
- Pioneered redbook audio integration for CD-ROM games[^ref-5]

**Select credits:**
| Year | Game | Role |
|------|------|------|
| 1989 | [[1989 - The Colonel's Bequest\|The Colonel's Bequest]] | Music, Sound |
| 1990 | [[1990 - King's Quest V - Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder\|King's Quest V]] | Composer |
| 1991 | [[1991 - Space Quest I - Roger Wilco in the Sarien Encounter\|Space Quest I VGA]] | Music |
| 1991 | [[1991 - Castle of Dr. Brain\|Castle of Dr. Brain]] | Music |

Allen later noted that working on the Space Quest series was his favorite assignment at Sierra: "I don't think any other game has been able to match the quality humor in those gems. And I had composed my brains out for the two guys."[^ref-5]

### Al Lowe – Designer and Composer

[[Al Lowe]], born 1946 in Chesterfield, Missouri, brought a unique perspective to game design with his degree in music education and background as a jazz artist.[^ref-14][^ref-15] His compositions for the Leisure Suit Larry series remain iconic.

The Leisure Suit Larry theme song was based on "Alexander's Ragtime Band," chosen because Lowe felt "it sounded so unusual, so different, so fresh compared to most computer game music."[^ref-16] Created casually with the attitude of "what the hell? It was only for a computer game," Lowe later marveled that his "silly little ditty would be heard by millions of gamers, many of whom have sworn revenge against me for making it so 'whistle-able' that they can't get it out of their heads."[^ref-16]

For [[1993 - Leisure Suit Larry 6 - Shape Up or Slip Out!\|Larry 6]], Lowe also performed alto saxophone on the opening theme.

### Robert Holmes – Gabriel Knight Series

Robert Holmes composed the atmospheric soundtracks for the [[1993 - Gabriel Knight - Sins of the Fathers\|Gabriel Knight]] trilogy, creating music that perfectly complemented Jane Jensen's supernatural mysteries.[^ref-17] Holmes married Jensen three years after the first game's release and would continue to compose for the entire series.[^ref-18]

For [[1995 - The Beast Within - A Gabriel Knight Mystery\|The Beast Within]], Holmes wrote the complete opera "Der Fluch Des Engelhart" with libretto by Jane Jensen—a remarkable achievement for a video game production.

The gospel hymn "When the Saints Go Marching In" appears in every Gabriel Knight game in different remixes, serving as a musical throughline for the series.[^ref-19]

### William Goldstein – King's Quest IV

Emmy-nominated composer William Goldstein, known for the Fame television series, created the groundbreaking score for [[1988 - King's Quest IV - The Perils of Rosella\|King's Quest IV]].[^ref-3] His contribution represented Sierra's first major investment in professional outside composition:

- Over 75 pieces of original music
- 40 minutes of total score
- Individual themes for each of 35 characters[^ref-3][^ref-4]

### Christopher Braymen

Chris Braymen contributed to several major Sierra titles, including the original soundtrack for [[1992 - King's Quest VI - Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow\|King's Quest VI]] (with additional contributions from Dan Kehler and Mark Seibert), [[1990 - Quest for Glory II - Trial by Fire\|Quest for Glory II]], and [[1991 - EcoQuest - The Search for Cetus\|EcoQuest]].[^ref-20]

In March 2024, Two Guys Records released "King's Quest VI - An Ode to the Isles," a two-LP vinyl reorchestration featuring Braymen alongside Erik Elsom and Error 47.[^ref-21]

- **Neal Grandstaff** – [[1994 - Outpost\|Outpost]], [[1994 - King's Quest VII - The Princeless Bride\|King's Quest VII]], [[1993 - Slater & Charlie Go Camping\|Slater & Charlie Go Camping]]
- **Craig Safan** – [[1991 - Leisure Suit Larry 5 - Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work\|Leisure Suit Larry 5]] (Emmy-nominated, Cheers theme songwriter)
- **Mike Dana** – [[1989 - Leisure Suit Larry III - Passionate Patti in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals\|Leisure Suit Larry III]]
- **Dan Kehler** – [[1992 - King's Quest VI - Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow\|King's Quest VI]], [[1994 - King's Quest VII - The Princeless Bride\|King's Quest VII]]

## Signature Themes and Memorable Pieces

### "Girl in the Tower" (King's Quest VI, 1992)

The love theme from [[1992 - King's Quest VI - Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow\|King's Quest VI]] became an unusual case study in video game marketing. Composed by Mark Seibert with lyrics by Jane Jensen and performed by Bob Bergthold and Debbie Seibert, the ballad was inspired by Cassima's theme from King's Quest V.[^ref-22]

Sierra attempted to promote the song through radio play, a bold experiment for game music at the time. Ken Williams envisioned the song becoming a radio hit comparable to popular movie tie-in ballads of the era. Sierra sent promotional CD singles to radio stations nationwide and included an 8-page pamphlet in every game box with phone numbers for major radio stations, urging customers to call and request the song.[^ref-23]

The campaign backfired spectacularly. Program directors called Ken to complain and made vague legal threats about FCC laws. Ken agreed to pull the pamphlet from future boxes.[^ref-23] The original 1992 promo CD single now commands $28-50 on the collector market.[^ref-21]

The song is referenced in multiple Sierra titles:
- [[1995 - Torin's Passage\|Torin's Passage]] (behind theater curtain)
- [[1993 - Leisure Suit Larry 6 - Shape Up or Slip Out!\|Leisure Suit Larry 6]] (phone number plays the song)
- [[2015 - King's Quest\|King's Quest 2015]] (tapestry in Gwendolyn's room)

### Leisure Suit Larry Theme

Al Lowe created the iconic theme on May 11, 1987, in just 20 minutes.[^ref-16] The melody, inspired by Irving Berlin's "Alexander's Ragtime Band" from 1929, evolved alongside game technology. As Lowe noted: "And to think, by Larry 7 we could actually have live musicians in a real recording studio play real instruments! Not only did my little Larry's Theme Song grow past the tweaking PC speaker, it outlived MIDI!"[^ref-16]

### King's Quest IV Score

William Goldstein's score for [[1988 - King's Quest IV - The Perils of Rosella\|King's Quest IV]] set new standards for game music. The Sierra Newsletter proclaimed the game showcased "40 minutes of the best sound available on any computer disk anywhere."[^ref-3]

### Gabriel Knight Jazz Themes

Robert Holmes's New Orleans jazz-infused score for [[1993 - Gabriel Knight - Sins of the Fathers\|Gabriel Knight]] established the atmospheric identity of the series.[^ref-17] The series won Computer Gaming World's Adventure Game of the Year in 1994.[^ref-24]
