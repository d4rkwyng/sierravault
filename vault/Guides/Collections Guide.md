# Collections & Anthologies Guide

This guide tracks the official collections, anthology boxes, and modern digital bundles that gather multiple Sierra (or Sierra-adjacent) games into one release. Use it to see which packages include a full series, which versions are shipped, and any quirks—such as missing Mac installers or bonus documentaries.

## Classic Boxed Anthologies

- **King’s Quest Collector’s Edition (1994)** – MS-DOS/Windows versions of KQ1–KQ6 plus a Roberta Williams interview disc; requires manual patching for sound in modern DOSBox installs.
- **King’s Quest 15th Anniversary (1998)** – Adds KQ7, a *Mask of Eternity* demo, and “King’s Domain,” a printed series timeline.
- **Space Quest Collection (1994 / 1997)** – SQ1–SQ5 with the VGA remake. The 1997 update adds SQ6, Windows installers, and a Roger Wilco timeline booklet.
- **Leisure Suit Larry Collection Series (1997)** – Larry 1–7 with both AGI and SCI variants plus Al Lowe commentary; paired earlier with the **“Greatest Hits and Misses” (1994)** box that covered Larry 1–5 and the Softporn Easter egg disk.
- **Police Quest Collection (1997)** – PQ1–PQ4 and SWAT 1.0. Includes Daryl F. Gates featurettes but omits the Sega CD-exclusive footage.
- **Quest for Glory Anthology (1996)** – QFG1 VGA through QFG4, import utilities, and a music CD; QFG5 remained a standalone release.
- **Roberta Williams Anthology (1996)** – Fifteen-disc omnibus covering *Mystery House*, Hi-Res Adventures, both Laura Bow games, and KQ1–KQ7 with a retrospective booklet.
- **Gabriel Knight Mysteries (1997)** – GK1 CD, GK2, GK3 demo, and “Making of” documentaries.
- **Phantasmagoria Collector’s Edition (1997)** – Phantasmagoria 1–2, soundtrack, Roberta interview, and a behind-the-scenes VHS.
- **Dynamix CyberPack (1995)** – *Rise of the Dragon*, *Heart of China*, and *Willy Beamish* DOS remasters.
- **Front Page Sports: Football Pro Collection (1996)** – Football Pro ’95/’96 plus stat disks and coaching guides.
- **After Dark Screensaver + Games bundle (1998)** – Combines Berkeley Systems’ screensavers with the *After Dark Games* compilation.
- **Sierra Discovery Series bundles (1992–1993)** – Classroom-focused packages such as *EcoQuest + Mixed-Up Mother Goose* or *Castle of Dr. Brain + Pepper’s Adventures* sold to schools with activity sheets.
- **Sierra Aces Collection (1995)** – *Aces of the Pacific* plus the WWII Expansion, *Aces Over Europe*, and the strategy guide.
- **3-D Ultra Pinball Value Pack (1998)** – First two 3-D Ultra pinball titles plus *Desktop Minigolf* on a single CD.
- **Japanese “Super Value” twin packs (1999)** – Region-specific bundles pairing *Gabriel Knight* or *Phantasmagoria* with local-language manuals.

## DVD / Early Digital Compilations

- **Sierra Originals & GOLD budget line (1997–1999)** – Jewel-case two packs (e.g., *GK1 + KQ6*, *SQ4 + SQ5*) sold under the “Sierra Originals” imprint; usually DOS-only executables with a shared launcher.
- **Sierra Classics Collection DVD (2006)** – Retail DVD from Vivendi bundling the then-current Windows installers for KQ, SQ, PQ, LSL, GK, QFG, and Phantasmagoria; essentially the same builds later sold on digital stores.
- **Best of Sierra (2007)** – Focused on post-1995 titles like *Caesar IV*, *Civilization: Call to Power*, *Homeworld*, and *SWAT 4* for strategy audiences.

## Modern Digital Bundles

- **GOG.com Series Packs** – GOG sells curated bundles for King’s Quest, Space Quest, Police Quest, Quest for Glory, Gabriel Knight, and SWAT. These typically include DOS/Windows versions preconfigured with DOSBox or ScummVM plus manuals and hint books.
- **Steam Sierra Classics Packs** – Similar to GOG but sometimes split into “Volume 1/2” SKUs. Steam versions of *Phantasmagoria* and *Gabriel Knight* use Windows-compatible installers with minor fan patches applied.
- **Activision’s “Sierra Bundle” (2016)** – Limited-time Humble/Steam bundle featuring *King’s Quest Collection*, *Space Quest Collection*, *Phantasmagoria 1–2*, *Gabriel Knight 1–3*, and *Police Quest Collection*.
- **Pinkerton Road Humble Bundle (2014)** – Included *Gabriel Knight 1 (20th Anniversary)*, *Moebius*, and *Cognition* episodes.
- **Humble “Sierra the Classics Return” (2020)** – Charity bundle mixing the 2015 *King’s Quest* episodic reboot with legacy DOS collections for KQ, SQ, PQ, and LSL, plus *Gabriel Knight* trilogy keys.
- **Console Store promos (2017–present)** – Occasional PlayStation and Xbox “Activision Hits” sales that package *King’s Quest (2015)*, *Geometry Wars 3*, and *Gabriel Knight Anniversary* for console players.

## Fan & Community Collections

- **The AGDI Remake Bundle** – Unofficial download that pairs *King’s Quest I VGA*, *KQ2+*, and *Quest for Glory II VGA* installers with linked documentation.
- **Space Quest Historians “Ultimate Collection” (curated list)** – Community spreadsheet cataloging exact DOS/Windows files plus fan remakes like *Vohaul Strikes Back*.
- **Sierra Help Pages Installer Packs** – Fan-made installers that combine anthology files with preconfigured DOSBox/ScummVM profiles and fan patches.
- **SCI Companion Preservation Sets** – Community archives focused on collecting every SCI interpreter build with matching resources; helpful when anthologies omit specific language versions.

## Tips for Using Collections

1. **Check installers:** DOSBox-based bundles sometimes omit Mac scripts; copy DOS folders into ScummVM or a fresh DOSBox profile if needed.
2. **Mind versions:** Anthologies often favor the latest SCI builds (e.g., SCI Larry 1). If you need the AGI originals, verify they’re included before purchase.
3. **Patches:** Apply community updates (e.g., QFG4 bug fixes, GK2 speed patch) immediately after installing from a collection.
4. **Manuals & codes:** Collections usually include PDFs of copy-protection charts; keep them handy for games that still prompt for page/word lookups.
5. **Console omissions:** Console-exclusive versions (Sega CD PQ1, PlayStation QFG5) rarely appear in PC collections; reference individual game pages for those releases.

Use this guide alongside the [[Site Index]] and [[Platform Guide]] to decide which anthology meets your needs, especially if you're curating an Obsidian Publish showcase or preparing captures for preservation.
