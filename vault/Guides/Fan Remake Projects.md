# Fan Remake Projects

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 2, 2026</small>

When Sierra Entertainment stopped making classic adventure games, the fan community stepped in. These dedicated groups have spent decades creating faithful VGA remakes, enhanced editions, and spiritual successors to Sierra's beloved franchises—all available for free.

---

## Overview

The Sierra fan remake community emerged in the early 2000s, driven by fans who grew up with AGI and early SCI games and wanted to see them reimagined with modern VGA graphics, point-and-click interfaces, and full voice acting.

Most fan remakes use **Adventure Game Studio (AGS)**, a free engine designed specifically for creating point-and-click adventure games in the Sierra/LucasArts tradition.

## Amiga Enhancement Projects

### Sierra Conversion Project (SCP)

**Founded:** ~2024
**Origin:** Spain
**Key Members:** DaRaSCo, kikems (AmigaWave), Estrayk
**Status:** Active

The [[2025 - SCP Sierra Conversion Project\|SCP Sierra Conversion Project]] enhances Sierra's notoriously poor Amiga ports by extracting, improving, and re-injecting graphics. Unlike VGA remakes that rebuild games from scratch, SCP preserves the original SCI engine while fixing the graphical compromises that made Sierra's Amiga conversions inferior to DOS versions.

**Released Enhancements:**

| Date | Game | Original | Download |
|------|------|----------|----------|
| Dec 2025 | Space Quest IV OCS Enhanced | [[1991 - Space Quest IV - Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers\|Space Quest IV - Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers]] | [MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/KtEj3IrD#S1uejpsbD2Vr8E5kldTYX3R2BqdNv3vtlIP4z9SBJPU) |
| Jan 2026 | King's Quest V OCS Remaster | [[1990 - King's Quest V - Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder\|King's Quest V - Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder]] | [MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/nx10ATrL#nD0W0Enyvpkzr80A59kU3-8XYBrqIS1XXeZCA4ZULpM) |
| Jan 2026 | Police Quest III Enhancement | [[1991 - Police Quest III - The Kindred\|Police Quest III - The Kindred]] | Contact SCP |

**In Development:**

| Game | Progress |
|------|----------|
| Conquests of the Longbow | 90% |
| Space Quest IV (Full Remaster) | 75% |

**Technical Approach:**
- Uses Amiga-native tools (ImageFX, PPaint, Adpro)
- Reconstructs color palettes to better match DOS VGA originals
- Includes MIDI support via Roland MT-32/mt32-pi
- Proves Sierra could have done better in the 1990s with existing tools

**Community:**
- [English Amiga Board](https://eab.abime.net/) — Technical discussions
- [Sierra Gaming World (Facebook)](https://www.facebook.com/SierraGamingWorld) — Announcements

## Legal Status

Most fan remakes operate under unofficial tolerance or negotiated fan licenses:

- **AGDI** — Operated with apparent tolerance from Sierra/Vivendi; no official license confirmed[^ref-7]
- **Phoenix Online** — Received cease-and-desist, then negotiated limited fan license for The Silver Lining
- **Current status** — With Sierra IP now owned by Microsoft (via Activision Blizzard acquisition), legal landscape is uncertain

**Note:** Fan remakes require owning the original games for some content (typically optional).
