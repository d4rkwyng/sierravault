# On Line Systems

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 15, 2026</small>

## Overview

On Line Systems was a pioneering video game development company founded in 1979 by Ken and Roberta Williams in Coarsegold, California.[^ref-1] The company emerged during the early days of personal computing and quickly established itself as an innovator in the adventure game genre, particularly known for creating some of the first graphic adventure games for home computers.[^ref-2] What began as a small husband-and-wife operation working out of their home would eventually evolve into Sierra On-Line, one of the most influential game publishers of the 1980s and 1990s.[^ref-3]

The company's significance extends far beyond its relatively short lifespan under the On Line Systems name. Ken Williams, a programmer at IBM, and his wife Roberta, who had become fascinated with text adventure games, recognized the potential of combining graphics with adventure gameplay at a time when most computer games were either purely text-based or simple arcade-style experiences.[^ref-4] Their vision of cinematic, story-driven games with colorful graphics would help define an entire genre and influence countless developers who followed.[^ref-5] The company's early success with titles like "Mystery House" and "The Wizard and the Princess" demonstrated that there was a hungry market for sophisticated narrative experiences on personal computers.[^ref-6]

## History

### Founding and Early Years

On Line Systems was born from Ken and Roberta Williams' shared passion for adventure games and their recognition of untapped potential in the emerging home computer market.[^ref-7] Ken Williams had been working as a programmer for IBM when Roberta discovered the text adventure game "Colossal Cave Adventure" on the company's mainframe computer in 1979.[^ref-8] Fascinated by the game's storytelling possibilities but frustrated by its purely text-based interface, Roberta conceived the idea of creating adventure games that combined narrative depth with visual graphics.[^ref-9]

The company's first major success came with "Mystery House" in 1980, which is widely credited as the first adventure game to feature graphics alongside text.[^ref-10] Developed by Roberta Williams and programmed by Ken, the game featured simple line-drawn graphics that illustrated each location, a revolutionary concept at the time.[^ref-11] The game's success, selling over 10,000 copies at $24.95 each, proved that there was significant commercial potential in graphic adventure games and provided the financial foundation for the company's expansion.[^ref-12]

Building on this early success, On Line Systems quickly expanded their catalog with the Hi-Res Adventure series, beginning with "The Wizard and the Princess" in 1980, which was notable for being one of the first adventure games to feature color graphics.[^ref-13] The company also diversified beyond adventure games, releasing arcade-style titles like "Threshold" and sports simulations including "Hi-Res Football" and "Hi-Res Soccer," demonstrating their technical capabilities across multiple genres.[^ref-14]

### Sierra Era

By 1982, the rapid growth and success of On Line Systems led to a significant rebranding as Sierra On-Line, reflecting the company's expanded scope and ambitions.[^ref-15] This transition marked the beginning of what would become one of the most influential periods in adventure gaming history. The Sierra On-Line name better reflected the company's vision of bringing high-quality entertainment software to the growing personal computer market, and it would become synonymous with innovative adventure games throughout the 1980s and 1990s.[^ref-16]

Under the Sierra banner, the company continued to push technological boundaries with increasingly sophisticated adventure games. The development of the Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) engine allowed for more complex puzzles, better graphics, and enhanced storytelling capabilities.[^ref-17] This period saw the creation of some of Sierra's most beloved franchises, including King's Quest, Space Quest, and Leisure Suit Larry, all of which traced their lineage back to the foundational work done during the On Line Systems era.[^ref-18]

The company's headquarters eventually moved from the Williams' home in Coarsegold to larger facilities that could accommodate their growing team of developers, artists, and support staff.[^ref-19] This expansion allowed Sierra On-Line to take on more ambitious projects and establish itself as a major force in the software entertainment industry, but the core vision established during the On Line Systems days remained central to their identity.[^ref-20]

## Notable Games

### Hi-Res Adventure 2: The Wizard and the Princess (1980)

"The Wizard and the Princess" represented a significant leap forward in adventure game technology and design, building upon the foundation established by "Mystery House."[^ref-1] The game was groundbreaking for its use of color graphics, making it one of the first adventure games to feature full-color illustrations on the Apple II computer.[^ref-2] Players took on the role of a wanderer seeking to rescue Princess Priscilla from the evil wizard Harlin, navigating through a fantasy world filled with puzzles, magical creatures, and treacherous obstacles.[^ref-3] The game's success helped establish On Line Systems as a serious player in the adventure game market and demonstrated the commercial viability of graphic adventures.

### Hi-Res Adventure 5: Time Zone (1982)

"Time Zone" was perhaps On Line Systems' most ambitious project, featuring an unprecedented scope that spanned multiple time periods and locations throughout history and the future.[^ref-4] The game came on six double-sided floppy disks and contained over 1,400 rooms, making it one of the largest adventure games ever created at the time.[^ref-5] Players traveled through different eras, from prehistoric times to the far future, solving puzzles and unraveling a complex plot involving time travel and interdimensional conflict.[^ref-6] Despite its innovative concept and massive scope, the game's high price point and extreme difficulty limited its commercial success, but it demonstrated the studio's willingness to push creative and technical boundaries.

### Threshold (1981)

"Threshold" marked On Line Systems' successful venture into the arcade game market, showcasing their versatility beyond adventure games.[^ref-7] Designed by Warren Schwader, the game was a space shooter that featured smooth scrolling graphics and intense action gameplay, demonstrating the company's technical prowess in creating fast-paced arcade experiences.[^ref-8] The game's success led to it being ported to multiple platforms and helped establish On Line Systems as a developer capable of creating compelling games across multiple genres.[^ref-9] "Threshold" also proved important financially for the company, providing steady revenue that supported their more experimental adventure game projects.

## Key People

Ken Williams served as the technical backbone of On Line Systems, bringing his programming expertise from IBM to the emerging world of personal computer gaming.[^ref-10] His ability to translate Roberta's creative visions into working code was essential to the company's early success, and his business acumen helped guide the company's growth from a home-based operation to a major software publisher.[^ref-11] Roberta Williams emerged as one of the first prominent female game designers, creating compelling narratives and innovative gameplay concepts that would influence adventure game design for decades to come.[^ref-12]

The Williams team also included talented programmers and designers like Warren Schwader, who contributed arcade-style games that helped diversify the company's portfolio.[^ref-13] As the company grew, they attracted other creative talents who would go on to create some of Sierra's most beloved franchises, building upon the foundation established during the On Line Systems era.[^ref-14]

## Legacy

On Line Systems' impact on the gaming industry extends far beyond its brief existence as an independent entity. The company's pioneering work in graphic adventure games established design principles and technical standards that influenced countless developers throughout the 1980s and beyond.[^ref-15] The Hi-Res Adventure series demonstrated that personal computers could deliver sophisticated storytelling experiences that rivaled or exceeded what was available on other platforms, helping to establish the PC as a serious gaming platform.[^ref-16]

The company's evolution into Sierra On-Line created one of the most influential publishers in gaming history, responsible for numerous classic franchises that are still remembered fondly by gamers today.[^ref-17] Many of the design philosophies and technical innovations pioneered during the On Line Systems era continued to influence Sierra's later productions and helped establish adventure gaming as a major genre.[^ref-18] The company's emphasis on strong narratives, memorable characters, and innovative use of technology set standards that continue to influence game development today.[^ref-19]
