<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 15, 2026</small>

## Overview

Infamous Quests is an independent video game development studio founded in 2012 by Steven Alexander and Shawn Mills, dedicated to creating original classic-style adventure games that pay homage to the golden age of Sierra On-Line.[^ref-1][^ref-9] The studio was established when the founders closed their previous fan remake studio, [[Infamous Adventures]], to transition from free fan projects to commercial original games.[^ref-10] The company operates as a small independent developer, relying on crowdfunding and community support to finance their projects while maintaining creative freedom to pursue their vision of traditional adventure gaming.[^ref-5]

The studio's philosophy centers around creating games that blend nostalgic gameplay elements with modern production values and storytelling techniques.[^ref-16][^ref-18] Their flagship title, *Quest for Infamy* (2014), serves as a spiritual successor to Sierra's Quest for Glory series, featuring multiple character classes and RPG elements.[^ref-1][^ref-9] Through their work, Infamous Quests has established itself as one of the leading developers in the adventure game revival movement.

## History

### Origins at Infamous Adventures

Before founding Infamous Quests, Steven Alexander and Shawn Mills operated [[Infamous Adventures]] (2004-2012), a fan remake studio that created free VGA remakes of classic Sierra games including King's Quest III and Space Quest II.[^ref-10][^ref-1] Through their work at Infamous Adventures, they honed their skills in adventure game development and built a loyal following within the Sierra fan community.[^ref-9][^ref-18]

### Founding and Transition to Commercial Development

In 2012, Alexander and Mills made the decision to close Infamous Adventures and establish Infamous Quests as a commercial venture focused on creating original adventure games.[^ref-10][^ref-1] This transition allowed them to pursue their long-standing goal of creating original content in the Sierra style, starting with *Quest for Infamy*, a project they had begun conceptualizing during the Infamous Adventures era.[^ref-16] The name "Infamous Quests" distinguished the new commercial studio from their previous fan project work.

### Development and Growth

Quest for Infamy was designed as a spiritual successor to Sierra's Quest for Glory series, featuring similar gameplay mechanics including character classes, RPG elements, and multiple solution paths.[^ref-10][^ref-1] To fund the project, the studio turned to Kickstarter crowdfunding, launching a successful campaign that demonstrated the continued demand for classic-style adventure games.[^ref-5]

The development process for Quest for Infamy took several years, with the small team working to create hand-drawn artwork, original music, and extensive dialogue trees that would provide the depth and replayability characteristic of their Sierra inspirations.[^ref-16][^ref-18] During this period, the studio also engaged actively with the adventure gaming community through forums, social media, and convention appearances, building a loyal fanbase eager to support their projects.[^ref-12][^ref-15]

### Modern Era and Continued Operations

After the release of Quest for Infamy in 2014, Infamous Quests continued developing adventure games while maintaining their focus on quality over quantity.[^ref-7][^ref-11] The studio released "Order of the Thorne: The King's Challenge" in 2016, further establishing their reputation for creating polished, authentic adventure game experiences.[^ref-1][^ref-7] Throughout this period, they have maintained their independence while exploring various funding models including Patreon subscriptions to support ongoing development.[^ref-5]

The studio continues to operate today, working on new projects while supporting their existing games with updates and community engagement.[^ref-12][^ref-15] Their approach remains consistent with their founding principles: creating adventure games that honor the legacy of Sierra while bringing fresh stories and modern production values to the genre.[^ref-1][^ref-9]

## Notable Games

### Quest for Infamy (2014)

Quest for Infamy stands as Infamous Quests' flagship title and their first major commercial release, serving as a spiritual successor to Sierra's beloved Quest for Glory series.[^ref-18][^ref-19] The game features three distinct character classes - Brigand, Rogue, and Sorcerer - each offering different approaches to puzzles and story progression, significantly enhancing replayability.[^ref-1] Players control Roehm, a scoundrel seeking redemption in the valley of Volksville, navigating through a world filled with humor, adventure, and moral choices that affect the story's outcome.[^ref-18][^ref-16]

### Order of the Thorne: The King's Challenge (2016)

Released as the studio's second commercial title, Order of the Thorne: The King's Challenge represents a more traditional point-and-click adventure experience while maintaining Infamous Quests' commitment to high-quality storytelling and artwork.[^ref-7][^ref-11] The game follows a knight's quest to prove his worthiness through a series of challenges set by the king, featuring beautiful hand-drawn graphics and challenging puzzles that require both wit and determination to solve.[^ref-1] This title demonstrated the studio's versatility in creating different types of adventure games while maintaining their signature attention to detail and authentic retro gameplay feel.[^ref-7]

### King's Quest II: Romancing the Stones (Fan Project)

Though not a commercial release, this fan-made remake of Sierra's King's Quest II served as Infamous Quests' introduction to the adventure gaming community and showcased their development capabilities.[^ref-18][^ref-1] The project completely reimagined the original 1985 game with modern graphics, expanded storylines, and enhanced gameplay mechanics while preserving the core adventure that made the original memorable.[^ref-16] This remake earned significant praise from the adventure gaming community and established the studio's reputation for faithful, high-quality recreations of classic gaming experiences.[^ref-18]

## Key People

Steven Alexander and Shawn Mills serve as the co-founders and primary creative forces behind Infamous Quests, bringing decades of combined passion for adventure games to their projects.[^ref-10][^ref-1] Alexander focuses primarily on game design and writing, crafting the intricate storylines and puzzle designs that characterize the studio's releases, while Mills handles much of the technical development and programming aspects.[^ref-10] Both founders have been active in the adventure gaming community for years before establishing the studio, participating in fan projects and community discussions that helped shape their understanding of what makes classic adventure games special.[^ref-18]

The studio operates with a small core team supplemented by freelance artists, musicians, and voice actors who contribute to specific projects.[^ref-15][^ref-12] This approach allows them to maintain creative control while accessing specialized talents needed for different aspects of game development, from hand-drawn artwork to original musical compositions that enhance the nostalgic atmosphere of their games.[^ref-1][^ref-16]

## Legacy
