# Coktel Vision

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 15, 2026</small>

## Overview

Coktel Vision was a French video game development studio founded in 1985 in Paris, France, that became renowned for creating some of the most distinctive and eccentric adventure games of the 1990s.[^ref-1][^ref-2] The company specialized in point-and-click adventure games with unique artistic styles, innovative gameplay mechanics, and often surreal or mature themes that set them apart from their contemporaries.[^ref-3][^ref-4] Under the leadership of founders Roland Oskian and others, Coktel Vision developed a reputation for pushing creative boundaries in interactive entertainment, producing everything from adult-oriented adventures to whimsical children's games.[^ref-5][^ref-6]

The studio gained international recognition after being acquired by American publisher Sierra On-Line in 1993, which provided them with greater distribution channels and resources to reach global audiences.[^ref-7][^ref-8] During their two-decade existence, Coktel Vision created over 30 games, including the beloved Gobliiins series, the time-travel epic Lost in Time, and various educational titles under the Playtoons brand.[^ref-9][^ref-10] Their games were characterized by hand-drawn artwork, complex puzzles, and a distinctly European sensibility that made them stand out in the predominantly American adventure game market of the era.[^ref-11][^ref-12]

## History

### Founding and Early Years

Coktel Vision was established in 1985 in Paris during the golden age of personal computing, when the French gaming industry was beginning to emerge as a creative force in Europe.[^ref-13][^ref-14] The company's founders, including Roland Oskian, were part of a generation of European developers who sought to create games that reflected their own cultural perspectives rather than simply following American gaming trends.[^ref-15] Their early releases in the late 1980s included ambitious projects like "20000 Leagues Under the Sea" (1988) and "African Raiders-01" (1988), which demonstrated their interest in literary adaptations and cinematic storytelling.[^ref-16]

The studio's early catalog revealed their willingness to explore mature and controversial themes, as evidenced by games like "Emmanuelle" (1989), based on the famous erotic novel series.[^ref-17][^ref-18] This bold approach to content would become a hallmark of Coktel Vision's identity, as they consistently created games that pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable in interactive entertainment. Their 1990 release "Geisha" further cemented their reputation for creating sophisticated, adult-oriented adventure games with high production values and complex narratives.[^ref-19]

### Sierra Era

The pivotal moment in Coktel Vision's history came in 1993 when they were acquired by Sierra On-Line, the legendary American publisher known for their King's Quest and Space Quest series.[^ref-7][^ref-20] This acquisition, announced in May 1994, was part of Sierra's strategy to expand their international presence and diversify their game portfolio with European talent.[^ref-16] Under Sierra's umbrella, Coktel Vision maintained creative autonomy while gaining access to superior marketing, distribution, and localization resources that allowed their games to reach audiences worldwide.[^ref-21]

The Sierra years proved to be Coktel Vision's most productive and critically acclaimed period. The Gobliiins series, which began in 1991, found new audiences through Sierra's distribution network and became one of the most beloved puzzle-adventure franchises of the 1990s.[^ref-1][^ref-3] Games like "Lost in Time" (1993) and "The Bizarre Adventures of Woodruff and the Schnibble" (1995) showcased the studio's ability to create complex, multi-layered adventures that appealed to both casual players and hardcore adventure game enthusiasts.[^ref-9][^ref-11]

### Later Years and Closure

Following Sierra On-Line's acquisition by Vivendi Universal in 1996, Coktel Vision continued operations but faced increasing pressure to adapt to changing market conditions.[^ref-21][^ref-14] The late 1990s and early 2000s saw a decline in the adventure game market as action games and first-person shooters gained dominance. The studio attempted to adapt by focusing more heavily on educational games and children's software, including the Playtoons series and various Asterix-themed titles.[^ref-4][^ref-10]

Despite their efforts to remain relevant, Coktel Vision struggled to maintain profitability in an increasingly competitive market that favored larger productions and different genres.[^ref-12][^ref-18] The studio officially closed its doors in 2005, marking the end of a twenty-year journey that had produced some of the most memorable and distinctive adventure games in gaming history.[^ref-5] Many former Coktel Vision developers went on to work for other French studios or founded their own companies, carrying forward the creative legacy of their unique approach to game design.[^ref-6]

## Notable Games

### Gobliiins (1991)

The original Gobliiins launched in 1991 and became Coktel Vision's most recognizable and commercially successful franchise.[^ref-1][^ref-9] The game featured three distinct goblin characters—Oups, Ignatius, and Asghan—each with unique abilities that players had to coordinate to solve elaborate puzzles. The innovative three-character mechanics, combined with Pierre Gilhodes's distinctive artwork and whimsical humor, created an adventure game unlike anything else on the market.[^ref-3][^ref-11] The series would eventually span four games, with each entry refining the formula while maintaining the charming aesthetic and challenging puzzle design that made the original so beloved.

### Lost in Time (1993)

"Lost in Time" represented Coktel Vision at their creative peak, delivering a complex time-travel narrative that spanned multiple historical periods and featured some of the most sophisticated puzzle design of the era.[^ref-9][^ref-19] The game's intricate plot involved a man searching for his missing fiancée across different time periods, from medieval castles to futuristic dystopias. With its mature themes, sophisticated artwork, and challenging gameplay, "Lost in Time" demonstrated Coktel Vision's ability to create adventure games that rivaled the best offerings from American studios while maintaining their distinctive European sensibility.[^ref-12][^ref-17]

### The Bizarre Adventures of Woodruff and the Schnibble (1995)

Released in 1995, "Woodruff and the Schnibble" showcased Coktel Vision's evolution into more experimental territory, featuring pre-rendered 3D backgrounds combined with traditional 2D animation.[^ref-11][^ref-14] The game's surreal science-fiction setting and bizarre characters pushed the boundaries of adventure game storytelling, creating an experience that was simultaneously confusing and compelling. Despite its commercial challenges, the game has gained cult status among adventure game enthusiasts who appreciate its uncompromising artistic vision and innovative design choices.[^ref-2][^ref-15]

## Key People

Roland Oskian served as one of Coktel Vision's co-founders and remained a driving creative force throughout the company's existence.[^ref-13][^ref-20] Pierre Gilhodes emerged as the studio's most celebrated artist and designer, responsible for the distinctive visual style of the Gobliiins series and many other Coktel Vision titles. His whimsical character designs and detailed backgrounds became synonymous with the company's aesthetic identity.[^ref-1][^ref-3] Other notable contributors included various programmers, artists, and designers who helped establish Coktel Vision's reputation for technical innovation and creative storytelling throughout the 1990s.[^ref-6][^ref-10]

## Legacy

Coktel Vision's impact on the adventure game genre extends far beyond their commercial success, as they demonstrated that European developers could create games with distinctly non-American sensibilities that still appealed to international audiences.[^ref-4][^ref-8] Their willingness to explore mature themes, experiment with unconventional gameplay mechanics, and maintain high artistic standards influenced a generation of adventure game developers who sought to push the boundaries of interactive entertainment.[^ref-5][^ref-18] The studio's technical innovations, particularly in areas like multi-character coordination and time-travel mechanics, can be seen in many modern adventure games and puzzle games.[^ref-12][^ref-21]
