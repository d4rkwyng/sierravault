# Infamous Adventures

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 15, 2026</small>

## Overview

Infamous Adventures was an independent adventure game development studio founded in 2004, best known for creating high-quality VGA remakes of classic Sierra On-Line adventure games.[^ref-1] The studio emerged from the passionate fan community surrounding Sierra's golden age titles, releasing their acclaimed free remakes of King's Quest III and Space Quest II before closing in 2012.[^ref-2]

Founded by Steven Alexander and Shawn Mills, Infamous Adventures operated as a fan project studio, releasing all games for free as tributes to the original Sierra titles.[^ref-3] In 2012, the founders closed Infamous Adventures and established **[[Infamous Quests]]** as a new commercial venture to create original adventure games, starting with the long-in-development *Quest for Infamy* (2014).[^ref-4] The transition marked a shift from fan remakes to original commercial content while maintaining the Sierra-inspired adventure game style.[^ref-5]

## History

### Founding and Early Years

Infamous Adventures was established in 2004 by a group of Sierra adventure game enthusiasts who were passionate about preserving and extending the legacy of classic adventure titles.[^ref-7] The studio's origins can be traced back to the fan community that emerged in the early 2000s, when Sierra On-Line's original adventure game series had been discontinued, leaving a void for players who craved new experiences in familiar worlds.[^ref-8] The founding team, led by Steven Alexander and Shawn Mills, initially focused on creating VGA remakes of beloved Sierra titles that had originally been released with EGA graphics or text-based interfaces.[^ref-9]

The studio's first major project was a complete remake of King's Quest III, transforming the original 1986 EGA version into a full VGA experience with updated graphics, voice acting, and enhanced gameplay mechanics.[^ref-10] This project established their reputation within the adventure gaming community and demonstrated their commitment to quality and authenticity.[^ref-11] The team worked entirely as volunteers during these early years, driven by passion rather than profit, and established a development philosophy that prioritized respect for the source material while incorporating modern improvements.[^ref-12]

### Sierra Era and Fan Projects

While Infamous Adventures never had an official relationship with Sierra Entertainment, their work was deeply influenced by and designed to complement the original Sierra catalog.[^ref-13] The studio operated in the gray area of fan projects, creating unauthorized but respectfully crafted remakes that Sierra chose not to pursue legally, likely recognizing the positive impact these projects had on keeping interest alive in their classic properties.[^ref-14] This period saw the release of their King's Quest III Redux in 2006, which was met with widespread acclaim from the adventure gaming community.[^ref-15]

Following the success of their King's Quest remake, the team expanded their ambitions to include other Sierra properties, beginning work on a VGA remake of Space Quest II.[^ref-16] This project, released in 2011, showcased the studio's growing technical capabilities and their ability to capture the humor and personality that made the original Sierra games so beloved.[^ref-17] The Space Quest II remake featured completely redrawn backgrounds, new character animations, full voice acting, and an enhanced musical score while maintaining the original's puzzle design and story structure.[^ref-18]

### Closure and Transition to Infamous Quests

In 2012, Steven Alexander and Shawn Mills made the decision to close Infamous Adventures and establish a new commercial venture, [[Infamous Quests]].[^ref-19] This transition allowed them to pursue original game development while maintaining the Sierra-inspired adventure game style they had honed through their remake projects.[^ref-20] The work they had begun on "Quest for Infamy" during the Infamous Adventures era was continued under the new Infamous Quests banner, eventually releasing in 2014.[^ref-21]

## Notable Games

### King's Quest III Redux (2006)

King's Quest III Redux stands as one of the most successful and influential fan-made adventure game remakes ever created, transforming Roberta Williams' 1986 classic from its original EGA presentation into a fully-featured VGA experience.[^ref-25] The remake featured completely redrawn backgrounds that captured the magical atmosphere of the original while providing modern visual fidelity, full voice acting for all characters, and an updated interface that made the game more accessible to contemporary players.[^ref-26] The project was notable for its faithful adherence to the original's story and puzzle design while enhancing every aspect of the presentation, earning praise from both longtime fans and newcomers to the series.[^ref-27]

### Space Quest II VGA Remake (2011)

The Space Quest II VGA remake demonstrated Infamous Adventures' versatility in handling different types of adventure games, successfully translating the humor and science fiction elements of the original 1987 game into a modern format.[^ref-28] This project showcased the team's growth as developers, featuring more sophisticated animation techniques, professional-quality voice acting, and enhanced musical compositions that elevated the source material while maintaining its distinctive character.[^ref-29] The remake was particularly praised for its ability to capture the comedic timing and visual gags that made the original Space Quest series so memorable, and would be the studio's final release before transitioning to [[Infamous Quests]].[^ref-30]

## Key People

Steven Alexander serves as the primary driving force behind Infamous Adventures, functioning as both project director and lead designer throughout the studio's history.[^ref-34] His vision for preserving and extending the Sierra adventure game legacy has shaped every project the studio has undertaken, and his perseverance through personal health challenges during the development of Quest for Infamy has become legendary within the adventure gaming community.[^ref-35] Alexander's background as both a programmer and designer has allowed him to maintain creative control over projects while also handling technical implementation.[^ref-36]

Shawn Mills has been instrumental in the studio's success as a key contributor to both the remake projects and original content development.[^ref-37] The collaborative relationship between Alexander and Mills has provided the stability and creative partnership necessary to complete ambitious projects with limited resources.[^ref-38] Other notable contributors include various voice actors, artists, and musicians who have worked with the studio on a volunteer or contract basis, creating a extended family of collaborators who share the studio's passion for adventure gaming.[^ref-39]

## Legacy

Infamous Adventures played a crucial role in keeping classic adventure gaming alive during a period when major publishers had largely abandoned the genre.[^ref-40] Their high-quality remakes demonstrated that there was still an audience for traditional point-and-click adventures and helped inspire other independent developers to pursue similar projects.[^ref-41] The studio's work has been recognized in various gaming publications and documentaries about the history of adventure gaming, cementing their place in the broader narrative of the genre's evolution.[^ref-42]

The studio's influence extends beyond their own releases, as their success with fan remakes helped establish precedents for how classic games could be lovingly updated for modern audiences.[^ref-43] Their approach to development, emphasizing quality over speed and passion over profit, became a model for other independent studios working on similar projects.[^ref-44] The adventure gaming community continues to regard Infamous Adventures as one of the most important preservators of Sierra's legacy, and the founders' subsequent work at [[Infamous Quests]] has shown that the skills and passion developed through fan projects can translate into successful commercial game development.[^ref-45]
