# Relic Entertainment

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 28, 2026</small>

## Overview

Founded in Vancouver in 1997 by Alex Garden and Luke Moloney, Relic Entertainment quickly gained attention for cinematic real-time strategy that emphasized bold art direction and narrative continuity. Sierra Studios published Relic's debut *Homeworld* (1999), a groundbreaking 3D space RTS that earned critical acclaim and established the studio's reputation for innovation. Sierra partnered with Relic again for *Homeworld 2* (2003) before the studio was acquired by THQ in 2004.

After THQ's bankruptcy in 2013, SEGA acquired Relic Entertainment. The studio continued developing acclaimed strategy games including the *Company of Heroes* and *Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War* franchises, as well as collaborating on *Age of Empires IV* with Xbox Game Studios.

## History

### Sierra Era (1997-2004)
- **1997:** Founded by Alex Garden, Luke Moloney, and Erin Daly in Vancouver.
- **1999:** Released *Homeworld* through Sierra, pioneering fully 3D space RTS with persistent fleets and cinematic storytelling.
- **2003:** Released *Homeworld 2* through Sierra/Vivendi, featuring refined UI and large-scale graphics upgrades.
- **2004:** Acquired by THQ; begins work on Warhammer 40,000 license.

### Post-Sierra (2004-Present)
After leaving Sierra's publishing umbrella, Relic became one of the premier RTS developers in the industry, creating multiple critically acclaimed franchises for THQ (2004-2013) and later SEGA (2013-2024). In March 2024, SEGA sold Relic and the studio went fully independent, announcing plans to focus on smaller experimental projects and explore remasters of classic titles. The studio released the well-received *Dawn of War Definitive Edition* in August 2025.

## Legacy

Relic's Sierra-era work cemented *Homeworld* as a prestige RTS franchise that influenced countless space strategy games. The IP's strength led to Gearbox acquiring the rights and releasing *Homeworld Remastered Collection* (2015), while Blackbird Interactive (founded by ex-Relic staff) continued the series with *Deserts of Kharak* (2016) and *Homeworld 3* (2024). Relic's innovations in 3D strategic gameplay and cinematic presentation during the Sierra era established foundations they would build upon with Company of Heroes and Dawn of War.
