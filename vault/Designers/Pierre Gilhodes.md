# Pierre Gilhodes

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 12, 2026</small>

## Overview

Pierre Gilhodes is a French video game designer who became renowned for creating some of the most distinctive and whimsical adventure games in the industry.[^ref-1] Best known as the creator of the beloved Gobliiins series, Gilhodes has crafted games that are considered "ovni" (unique phenomena) in the video game world, marking players' minds with their atypical and offbeat character.[^ref-2] His career spans over three decades, from his early work at Coktel Vision through to his current status as an independent developer continuing the legacy of his most famous creations.

Gilhodes is notable for his background in desktop publishing (DTP) and drawing rather than traditional programming.[^ref-3] Despite not being a programmer by training, he has managed to create some of the most memorable adventure games of the 1990s, working primarily with development tools that he admits he "cannot completely parameterize."[^ref-4] His approach to game design emphasizes creative problem-solving and artistic vision over technical prowess, resulting in games with unique visual styles and unconventional gameplay mechanics that have captivated players for generations.

## Career

### Early Career

Gilhodes entered the game industry through his artistic background, having studied desktop publishing and drawing.[^ref-3] He presented his works to Coktel Vision in 1989, quickly establishing himself as a creative force in the French gaming scene during the late 1980s and early 1990s.[^ref-41] He contributed to various projects as an illustrator and graphics artist, honing his skills in visual storytelling that would later become crucial to his success as a game designer.[^ref-5]

His earliest credited work was Asterix: Operation Getafix (1989), where he provided graphics under the name "Pierre."[^ref-37] This was followed by work on Geisha and Los Tres Cerditos Se Divierten (The Three Little Pigs Have Fun), both in 1990, where he demonstrated his ability to create compelling visual narratives across different styles and audiences.[^ref-6] These early projects served as stepping stones to more ambitious works, allowing him to develop his understanding of interactive entertainment while building relationships within the industry that would prove invaluable throughout his career.

### Coktel Vision and Sierra Years

The pinnacle of Gilhodes' early career came with the creation of the original [[1991 - Gobliiins\|Gobliiins]] in 1991, which he developed while working with Coktel Vision under the Sierra umbrella.[^ref-7] This breakthrough title established him as a major talent in the adventure game genre and launched what would become one of the most beloved puzzle-adventure series in gaming history.

Following the success of the first game, Gilhodes continued to develop the series with [[1992 - Gobliins 2 - The Prince Buffoon\|Gobliins 2: The Prince Buffoon]] (1992) and [[1993 - Goblins Quest 3\|Goblins Quest 3]] (1993).[^ref-8] During this period, he also contributed to other notable projects including Once Upon a Time: Abracadabra (1991) and Once Upon a Time: Baba Yaga (1991) as an illustrator, and was credited as creator on [[1992 - Inca\|Inca]] (1992), Coktel Vision's action-adventure game blending space combat with puzzle-solving in an alternate-history Incan setting.[^ref-9]

His work expanded beyond the Gobliiins series during the mid-1990s, contributing graphics and artwork to [[1995 - The Bizarre Adventures of Woodruff and the Schnibble\|The Bizarre Adventures of Woodruff and the Schnibble]] (1995), which he describes as "créateur du jeu" (creator of the game).[^ref-2] This project demonstrated his versatility as both a visual artist and game designer, creating complex narratives that pushed the boundaries of adventure game storytelling.

### Later Career

After his initial success with Coktel Vision and Sierra, Gilhodes continued working in various capacities throughout the 2000s.[^ref-10] Following a brief hiatus from the industry, he returned with 3D animation work on Ben Hur: Blood of Braves (2003) for MAS Productions and contributed as a 2D/3D artist on Bet on Soldier: Blood Sport (2005) for Kylotonn.[^ref-11]

#### Wizarbox Period (2008–2012)

Gilhodes found steady work at Wizarbox, a French adventure game studio, contributing character animations to multiple projects.[^ref-37] His work there included So Blonde (2008), Scrabble Interactive: 2009 Edition (2009), and Gray Matter (2010)—the latter being Jane Jensen's acclaimed mystery adventure developed by Wizarbox.[^ref-38] He also contributed to So Blonde: Back to the Island (2010), an alternate reality spin-off of the original game, serving as both 3D artist and character animator.[^ref-39]

His Wizarbox contributions continued through 2012 with Captain Morgane and the Golden Turtle, a prequel to the So Blonde series, and R.A.W: Realms of Ancient War, an action RPG—both projects where he provided character animations.[^ref-40] This period demonstrated his adaptability, working across adventure games, puzzle games, and action RPGs while maintaining his artistic expertise in character animation.

#### Return to Gobliiins

In 2009, concurrent with his Wizarbox work, Gilhodes returned to his most famous creation with [[2009 - Gobliiins 4\|Gobliiins 4]], reviving the series after more than a decade.[^ref-12] He assembled a team called Société Pollene specifically to develop the fourth installment.[^ref-41] This return marked the beginning of his transition to independent development, eventually leading to his presence on platforms like itch.io where he continues to develop games independently.[^ref-13]

Most recently, in 2023, Gilhodes released [[2023 - Gobliiins 5 - The Morgloton Invasion\|Gobliiins 5: The Morgloton Invasion]] as an independent developer.[^ref-14] He has also announced plans for Gobliins 6, stating "Merci pour tes encouragements ! J'espère que Gobliiins5 te plaira. Le suivant est commencé, Gobliins6, qui est la suite de Gobliins2."[^ref-15]

## Notable Works

### Gobliiins (1991)

The original Gobliiins stands as Gilhodes' masterpiece and the foundation of his reputation in the gaming industry.[^ref-16] Interestingly, the game underwent significant changes during development. As Gilhodes explains: "Dans sa toute première mouture, Goblins 1 (Gobliiins) était à l'origine un jeu d'action mettant en scène trois personnages bougeant simultanément et contrôlés indépendamment. Mais des contraintes de programmation m'ont forcé à le transformer en jeu d'aventure, tout en gardant le principe des trois p[ersonnages]."[^ref-17] This transformation from action to adventure game proved serendipitous, creating a unique puzzle-solving experience that would define the series.

The game's success established Gilhodes as a master of whimsical character design and innovative puzzle mechanics. The three goblin characters—each with distinct abilities and personalities—became iconic figures in adventure gaming, described as "ces petits êtres malicieux qui égayent nos écrans depuis 1991" (these mischievous little beings who have brightened our screens since 1991).[^ref-18]

### The Bizarre Adventures of Woodruff and the Schnibble (1995)

This ambitious project showcased Gilhodes' ability to create complex, mature narratives while maintaining his signature whimsical style.[^ref-19] The game featured innovative shadow-control mechanics, with the inspiration coming from an unexpected source. As Gilhodes reveals: "L'idée du contrôle de l'ombre m'est venue après avoir vu le film Dracula" (The idea of shadow control came to me after seeing the Dracula film).[^ref-20]

The game pushed technical boundaries and demonstrated Gilhodes' evolution as a designer, incorporating more sophisticated storytelling and gameplay mechanics while retaining the charm and humor that characterized his earlier works. However, despite its current cult status, Gilhodes acknowledges the challenges of creating a sequel: "Woodruff's sequel is a complex project, especially for a single person... It's not for now. I'm starting Gobliins6 for now."[^ref-21]

### Gobliiins 5: The Morgloton Invasion (2023)

His most recent major work represents both a return to his roots and an evolution of his design philosophy.[^ref-22] Working as an independent developer, Gilhodes created this game using modern tools while maintaining the classic pixel art aesthetic that fans expect. When discussing visual rendering preferences, he notes: "It's true, it's smoother like that, but less pixel art," showing his commitment to maintaining the series' distinctive visual identity.[^ref-23]

The game demonstrates his continued dedication to the adventure genre and his willingness to engage directly with fans through platforms like itch.io and social media. His hands-on approach to fan interaction is evident in personal responses like "Je t'envoie ça. A bientôt Pierre" when fulfilling fan requests for game access.[^ref-24]

## Design Philosophy

Gilhodes' approach to game design is characterized by creative problem-solving within technical constraints rather than programming expertise.[^ref-25] He openly acknowledges his limitations, stating "I am not a programmer and I use a tool that I cannot completely parameterize," yet this hasn't prevented him from creating innovative and beloved games.[^ref-26] His philosophy emphasizes artistic vision and player experience over technical sophistication.

His preference for 2D adventure games and pixel art aesthetics reflects a commitment to timeless design principles rather than chasing the latest technological trends.[^ref-27] This approach has allowed his games to age gracefully and maintain their appeal across multiple decades. When responding to technical feedback, he explains: "I would like to consider your message for the next game but it is not always possible and it is already well started. I am not a programmer and I use a tool that I cannot completely parameterize."[^ref-28]

Gilhodes draws inspiration from unexpected sources, as evidenced by his shadow control mechanic inspired by Dracula films, demonstrating his ability to translate cinematic concepts into interactive gameplay elements.[^ref-29] His personal gaming preferences also inform his design choices—as someone who enjoys "jeux d'action et d'aventure, avec une passion pour Tetris" (action and adventure games, with a passion for Tetris)—he brings an understanding of what makes games engaging and replayable.[^ref-30]

## Legacy

Pierre Gilhodes has left an indelible mark on the adventure game genre, creating experiences that continue to find new audiences decades after their initial release.[^ref-31] His work is frequently cited by adventure game enthusiasts and has influenced numerous designers who appreciate his unique blend of humor, creativity, and puzzle design. The Gobliiins series in particular has achieved cult status, with active fan communities still discussing and celebrating these games on platforms like Reddit and specialized gaming forums.[^ref-32]

His impact extends beyond individual games to encompass a philosophy of independent creativity within commercial game development.[^ref-33] As someone who achieved success without traditional programming skills, Gilhodes represents the importance of artistic vision and creative problem-solving in game design. His current work as an independent developer continues to inspire others who seek to create personal, distinctive games outside the mainstream industry.

The ongoing development of new entries in the Gobliiins series demonstrates the enduring appeal of his creations and his commitment to his fan base.[^ref-34] His announcement of crowdfunding plans for future projects ("Il y aura un crowdfunding dans quelques temps") shows his adaptation to modern development models while maintaining his creative independence.[^ref-35] Plans for console versions of his recent work ("Many thanks! The Switch and other consoles version is well planned") indicate his awareness of expanding his games' reach to new platforms and audiences.[^ref-36]
