# Jerry Moore

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 13, 2026</small>

## Overview

Gerald "Jerry" Moore is an American artist and game industry veteran who contributed to numerous Sierra On-Line titles during the company's golden age of adventure games.[^ref-1] Born in Ridgecrest, California in 1952, Moore combined formal training in commercial art with a minor in computer science, a dual background that proved invaluable during the early days of computer graphics when technical understanding was as important as artistic skill.[^ref-1]

Moore's Sierra career spanned from 1984 to 1994, during which he contributed graphics and animation to landmark titles including [[1988 - King's Quest IV - The Perils of Rosella\|King's Quest IV]], [[1990 - King's Quest V - Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder\|King's Quest V]], [[1989 - Quest for Glory I - So You Want to Be a Hero\|Hero's Quest: So You Want to Be a Hero]], [[1991 - Space Quest IV - Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers\|Space Quest IV]], and [[1989 - The Colonel's Bequest\|The Colonel's Bequest]].[^ref-2] His extensive collaboration with fellow Sierra artists helped establish the visual style that defined the company's transition from EGA to VGA graphics.

A founding member of the Association of Christian Entertainment (ACE), Moore later established Dimensions Vertical, a small video game company he runs with his son Devin, focused on faith-based gaming projects.[^ref-1]

## Career

### Education and Early Background

Moore graduated from Point Loma College in 1975 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Commercial Art and a minor in Computer Science.[^ref-1] This unusual combination of artistic and technical training positioned him well for the emerging field of computer graphics, where understanding both pixel-level manipulation and aesthetic principles was essential.

### Sierra On-Line (1984–1994)

Moore's earliest known Sierra credit came on [[1984 - Donald Duck's Playground\|Donald Duck's Playground]] (1984), where he provided graphics alongside Doug MacNeill for this acclaimed Disney-licensed educational game designed by [[Al Lowe]].[^ref-3] The game won several awards from educational software magazines as best educational game of the year, and Moore's graphics helped bring Al Lowe's design to life across multiple platforms including the Commodore 64 and TRS-80 CoCo.[^ref-4]

By 1987, Moore had become a regular contributor to Sierra's growing catalog. He provided graphics for [[1987 - Police Quest - In Pursuit of the Death Angel\|Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel]] and [[1987 - Mixed-Up Mother Goose\|Roberta Williams' Mixed-Up Mother Goose]], demonstrating versatility across both adult-oriented adventure games and children's titles.[^ref-2]

The transition to SCI-era productions saw Moore's responsibilities expand. On [[1988 - King's Quest IV - The Perils of Rosella\|King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella]] (1988), Sierra's first major SCI game, he contributed animation work alongside fellow artists William D. Skirvin and Carolly Hauksdottir that helped establish new standards for character movement in adventure games.[^ref-6][^ref-8] His animation and background scene work on [[1989 - Quest for Glory I - So You Want to Be a Hero\|Hero's Quest: So You Want to Be a Hero]] (1989) helped create the distinctive visual identity of what would become the Quest for Glory series.[^ref-5]

Moore collaborated extensively with Douglas Herring on [[1989 - The Colonel's Bequest\|The Colonel's Bequest]] (1989), contributing graphics and artwork to Roberta Williams' atmospheric murder mystery set in 1920s Louisiana.[^ref-7][^ref-11] He also provided additional artwork for [[1990 - Codename - Iceman\|Code-Name: Iceman]] and graphic arts for [[1989 - Hoyle Official Book of Games - Volume 1\|Hoyle: Official Book of Games - Volume 1]].[^ref-2]

The VGA era brought Moore's most prolific period. On [[1990 - King's Quest V - Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder\|King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder!]] (1990), he served as one of the artists contributing to Sierra's first major VGA game—which became the best-selling adventure game of all time.[^ref-9] He contributed backgrounds and animation to [[1990 - Quest for Glory II - Trial by Fire\|Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire]][^ref-13] and artist work on [[1990 - Hoyle Official Book of Games - Volume 2\|Hoyle: Official Book of Games - Volume 2: Solitaire]].[^ref-2]

Moore continued his prolific output into 1991, contributing graphics and artwork to [[1991 - Space Quest IV - Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers\|Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers]][^ref-10], background art and animation to [[1991 - Conquests of the Longbow - The Legend of Robin Hood\|Conquests of the Longbow: The Legend of Robin Hood]][^ref-12], and art design work for the VGA remake [[1990 - Mixed-Up Mother Goose (SCI Remake)\|Mixed-Up Mother Goose]].[^ref-2]

His final Sierra credits included "Incredible Artwork" on [[1992 - Quest for Glory I - So You Want to Be a Hero VGA\|Quest for Glory I VGA]] (1992)[^ref-14], additional animation on [[1993 - Freddy Pharkas - Frontier Pharmacist\|Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist]] (1993), and graphics work on [[1993 - EcoQuest - Lost Secret of the Rainforest\|Lost Secret of the Rainforest]] (1993).[^ref-2]

### Westwood Studios and Later Career

Beyond Sierra, Moore contributed to Westwood Studios' Legend of Kyrandia series, providing graphics and artwork for The Legend of Kyrandia: Hand of Fate (1993) and artist work on The Legend of Kyrandia: Malcolm's Revenge (1994).[^ref-2][^ref-15] He also contributed to SimCity 2000 CD Collection (1994) (1994), creating the "Spiralopolis" scenario.[^ref-2]

Moore later received a "Special Thanks" credit on Happy Wars (2015), indicating continued involvement in the gaming industry.[^ref-2]

### Dimensions Vertical

As a founding member of ACE (Association of Christian Entertainment), Moore has remained active in faith-based gaming initiatives.[^ref-1] He currently heads Dimensions Vertical, a small video game company he runs with his son Devin. Their ongoing project, Progress 21, is a 21st-century adaptation of John Bunyan's classic allegory Pilgrim's Progress, on which they continue to seek additional funding.[^ref-1]

## Notable Works

### King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella (1988)

Moore's animation work on [[1988 - King's Quest IV - The Perils of Rosella\|King's Quest IV]] contributed to Sierra's first SCI-engine adventure game, helping establish new standards for character animation in the genre.[^ref-6][^ref-8]

### Hero's Quest / Quest for Glory I (1989/1992)

Moore provided animation and background scenes for the original [[1989 - Quest for Glory I - So You Want to Be a Hero\|Hero's Quest]] (1989), helping establish the visual identity of Corey and Lori Cole's innovative RPG-adventure hybrid.[^ref-5] He later contributed "Incredible Artwork" to the [[1992 - Quest for Glory I - So You Want to Be a Hero VGA\|VGA remake]] (1992), updating the game's visuals for the 256-color era.[^ref-2]

### The Colonel's Bequest (1989)

Working alongside Douglas Herring on [[1989 - The Colonel's Bequest\|The Colonel's Bequest]], Moore contributed graphics and artwork to one of Sierra's most atmospheric adventure games.[^ref-7][^ref-11] The murder mystery's detailed character animations and moody plantation backgrounds helped create an unusually character-driven experience.

### King's Quest V (1990)

As one of the artists on [[1990 - King's Quest V - Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder\|King's Quest V]], Moore contributed to Sierra's landmark VGA release.[^ref-9] The game's 256-color graphics represented a massive leap in visual fidelity, and its commercial success validated Sierra's investment in higher-fidelity visuals.

### Space Quest IV (1991)

Moore's graphics and artwork contributions to [[1991 - Space Quest IV - Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers\|Space Quest IV]] helped bring the Two Guys from Andromeda's time-traveling comedy adventure to life.[^ref-10] The game's varied visual styles—spanning multiple time periods—required versatile artists who could adapt to different aesthetic requirements.

## Legacy

Jerry Moore's extensive body of work at Sierra places him among the company's most prolific artists during the transition from EGA to VGA graphics. His collaborations with artists like Douglas Herring, Gerald Moore, and other Sierra contributors helped establish the visual language of classic adventure games.[^ref-2]

His dual background in commercial art and computer science exemplified the hybrid skill set that early game artists needed, combining aesthetic sensibility with technical understanding of the constraints and possibilities of computer graphics systems. Moore's contributions to landmark titles like King's Quest IV, King's Quest V, and the Quest for Glory series helped define the look of Sierra's golden age.
