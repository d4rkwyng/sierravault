# Bob Heitman

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 12, 2026</small>

## Overview

Robert Eric Heitman (b. November 4, 1951), known professionally as Bob Heitman, was one of Sierra On-Line's first employees and a pivotal figure in the development of the company's game engine technology.[^ref-1] As co-developer of both the Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) and its successor, Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI), Heitman helped create the technological foundation that powered virtually every Sierra adventure game from the mid-1980s through the late 1990s.[^ref-2] He also directed the group that added the 256-color VGA extensions to SCI, enabling the visual leap that defined Sierra's golden age.[^ref-3]

Heitman's career at Sierra began in 1982 as a conversion programmer, porting Sierra's early graphics adventures to the Commodore 64.[^ref-3] His technical expertise and understanding of multiple hardware platforms made him invaluable during an era when games needed to run across diverse computer systems. Rising through the ranks, he served as VP of Engineering, VP of Product Development, and acting General Manager for The Sierra Network before departing in late 1991.[^ref-3]

After leaving Sierra, Heitman created the TsAGE (Tsunami Adventure Game Engine) for Tsunami Media, essentially rebuilding Sierra's SCI technology independently.[^ref-4] In 1993, he founded Triton Interactive, his own consulting and programming company, which allowed him to work with multiple clients including Interplay, Legend Entertainment, Legacy Software, and Microsoft over the following decade.[^ref-3]

## Career

### Early Career

Heitman joined Sierra On-Line in 1982 during the company's early growth period, initially working as a conversion programmer responsible for adapting Sierra's Apple II games to other platforms like the Commodore 64.[^ref-3] This work required deep understanding of both source and target hardware architectures, establishing Heitman's reputation for technical versatility. He joined Sierra's original educational software group and was responsible for several titles including a completely revised Commodore 64 version of Learning with Leeper and an original product called Story Maker, a text and graphics editor designed to allow children to create shareable stories.[^ref-3]

In 1985, he took on the significant project of porting Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress to the Atari ST, one of the earliest commercially released games for that system.[^ref-5] His early work at Sierra positioned him to become involved in the company's most important technical initiative: the development of the Adventure Game Interpreter.[^ref-2]

### Sierra Years (1982–1991)

Throughout his tenure at Sierra, Heitman worked on refining and extending the AGI engine while also contributing directly to game development.[^ref-6] Working alongside Jeff Stephenson, Chris Iden, and Sol Ackerman, Heitman contributed to the creation of AGI, the engine that would power Sierra's first generation of point-and-click adventure games and revolutionize the gaming industry.[^ref-7] His programming credits span many of Sierra's most beloved franchises, including King's Quest, Space Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, Police Quest, Manhunter, and Gold Rush!.[^ref-1]

Heitman programmed King's Quest III along with Al Lowe and Robert Kernhagan, then went on to co-develop the SCI system with Jeff Stephenson.[^ref-3] This successor to AGI represented a major technological leap, supporting 256-color graphics, improved sound capabilities, and more sophisticated game logic. [[1988 - King's Quest IV - The Perils of Rosella\|King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella]] became the first game to use SCI, demonstrating the engine's capabilities and setting the technical standard for Sierra's golden age of adventure gaming.[^ref-8]

As Programming Manager, Heitman oversaw numerous Sierra development teams.[^ref-9] His responsibilities expanded beyond direct programming as the SCI engine matured, with credits for "Development System" appearing on titles like the Hoyle series, Jones in the Fast Lane, Leisure Suit Larry 5, and Mixed-Up Fairy Tales.[^ref-1] He also served as the SCI system developer during production of games like Conquests of the Longbow, where his management of art lists and technical requirements proved essential.[^ref-10]

Rising through Sierra's ranks, Heitman eventually served as VP of Engineering and VP of Product Development, and as acting General Manager for The Sierra Network (TSN), Sierra's pioneering online gaming service.[^ref-3] His time at TSN exposed him to the emerging world of online multiplayer gaming that would influence his later career.

### Tsunami Media (1991–1993)

After leaving Sierra in late 1991, Heitman contracted with Tsunami Media, a company founded by former Sierra employees including CFO Edmond Heinbockel.[^ref-4] At Tsunami, he created the TsAGE (Tsunami Adventure Game Engine), which was essentially a refurnished SCI engine rebuilt independently so Sierra's legal team couldn't challenge it.[^ref-4] The engine powered all of Tsunami's adventure and strategy titles.

His most significant Tsunami project was Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch (1992), based on Larry Niven's Known Space novels, for which he served as Game Designer.[^ref-11] He also developed the TsAGE engine that powered Blue Force, Jim Walls's spiritual successor to the Police Quest series,[^ref-4] as well as Wacky Funsters: The Geekwad's Guide to Gaming (1992), The Geekwad: Games of the Galaxy (1993), and Protostar: War on the Frontier (1993).[^ref-12]

During this period, Heitman also created the Passport2 online gaming network for Tsunami, continuing his work in the emerging online multiplayer space.[^ref-2]

### Triton Interactive (1993–2002)

In 1993, Heitman founded Triton Interactive, his own consulting and programming company based in Oakhurst, California.[^ref-3] This allowed him to work with multiple clients across the gaming industry while maintaining independence.

His post-Sierra work included significant projects across multiple genres. For Interplay, he contributed as Additional System Programmer on Star Trek: Judgment Rites.[^ref-13] He programmed Man Enough (1994) and Dinonauts (1995), both games that emerged from the Tsunami/Triton circle.[^ref-1]

Heitman's most acclaimed freelance project was [[1995 - Shannara\|Shannara]] for Legend Entertainment, based on Terry Brooks's fantasy novels. Working with Corey Cole—whom he had supervised at Sierra—Heitman programmed the map and combat systems ("RPG lite") for what became Legend's last and best-selling game.[^ref-9] The Coles hired several ex-Sierra people to work on Shannara, and Heitman's experience with both adventure game engines and RPG mechanics made him ideal for the project.

In 1998, Heitman returned to Sierra as a System Software Engineer for [[1998 - Quest for Glory V - Dragon Fire\|Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire]], reuniting with the Coles on the final entry in the series he had helped make possible as their original supervisor.[^ref-14]

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Heitman worked on several licensed Game Boy Color titles through contracts with Legacy Software and other publishers. These included Barbie: Fashion Pack Games (2000) as Programmer, *NSYNC: Get to the Show (2001) for System Development, and Dora the Explorer: Lost City Adventure (2002) as Engineer.[^ref-1]

## Notable Works

### Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI)

Heitman's contribution to the Adventure Game Interpreter represents one of his most significant achievements.[^ref-2] Developed in the early 1980s, AGI was designed to power Sierra's revolutionary graphics adventure games, beginning with King's Quest I.[^ref-7] The engine utilized all 16 colors of the EGA graphics adapter and allowed players to interact with animated characters in real-time environments. Heitman's work on AGI helped establish Sierra as the leading adventure game company of the 1980s.

### Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI)

The SCI engine, co-developed by Heitman with Jeff Stephenson in 1988, represented a generational leap in adventure game technology.[^ref-2] Supporting 256-color VGA graphics, enhanced sound capabilities, and more complex game logic, SCI enabled Sierra to create increasingly sophisticated and visually impressive games.[^ref-8] Heitman directed the group that added the 256-color VGA extensions to SCI, making possible the visual transformation seen in King's Quest V and subsequent titles.[^ref-3] The engine powered Sierra's most successful titles throughout the late 1980s and 1990s.

### TsAGE (Tsunami Adventure Game Engine)

After leaving Sierra, Heitman created TsAGE for Tsunami Media, rebuilding Sierra's engine technology independently.[^ref-4] The engine powered nine titles: Blue Force, Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch, Return to Ringworld, Wacky Funsters, The Geekwad: Games of the Galaxy, Protostar: War on the Frontier, Man Enough, Silent Steel, and Flash Traffic: City of Angels.[^ref-12] TsAGE's architecture was similar enough to SCI that modern preservation projects like ScummVM treat them as related but distinct engines.

### Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch (1992)

As Game Designer on Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch, Heitman applied his Sierra experience to adapting Larry Niven's Hugo Award-winning science fiction novels for interactive entertainment.[^ref-11] The game demonstrated that Tsunami could produce adventure games competitive with Sierra's output, featuring the same style of point-and-click interface and puzzle-driven gameplay.

### King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella (1988)

As System Programmer on [[1988 - King's Quest IV - The Perils of Rosella\|King's Quest IV]], Heitman worked on the first game built on the SCI engine.[^ref-8] The game's improved graphics and sound demonstrated what the new engine could achieve, helping Sierra maintain its position at the forefront of adventure gaming technology and setting the template for all SCI games that followed.

## Design Philosophy

Heitman's approach to game development emphasized creating flexible, powerful tools that empowered designers and programmers to realize their creative visions.[^ref-2] His work on AGI, SCI, and later TsAGE reflected a philosophy of building robust foundational technology that could support diverse game types and evolve with advancing hardware capabilities. This platform-minded thinking helped establish Sierra's technical leadership in the adventure gaming market.

His experience porting games across multiple platforms gave him deep appreciation for the challenges of cross-platform development, influencing his engine design decisions to maximize code portability and minimize platform-specific complications.[^ref-3] This practical understanding of real-world development constraints made his technical contributions particularly valuable to Sierra's operations.

As Programming Manager, Heitman was known for his attention to production planning. On Conquests of the Longbow, he approached the lead artist and producer seeking art lists before production began—a methodical approach to development that anticipated modern game production practices.[^ref-10]

## Legacy

Bob Heitman's contributions to Sierra On-Line extend far beyond his individual game credits to encompass the technological infrastructure that made the company's golden age possible.[^ref-1] The AGI and SCI engines he helped develop powered dozens of games and established technical standards that influenced adventure game development industry-wide.[^ref-2] His work enabled Sierra's creative teams to focus on storytelling and puzzle design rather than low-level technical challenges.

The influence of Heitman's engine work can be seen in the continued interest in AGI and SCI among retro gaming enthusiasts and preservationists.[^ref-15] Projects to reverse-engineer and document these engines, most notably ScummVM, have helped preserve Sierra's legacy and enabled modern players to experience classic games on contemporary systems. His TsAGE engine is similarly preserved, with ScummVM supporting all nine Tsunami titles.[^ref-12]

Corey Cole, who worked under Heitman at Sierra before hiring him for Shannara, described him as his "boss—programming manager—when I started at Sierra, and when we made Hero's Quest."[^ref-9] This passing of knowledge and collaboration across multiple companies and projects exemplifies Heitman's lasting influence on the Sierra diaspora and the broader adventure game development community.
