## Overview

Doug Oldfield is an American programmer who worked at Sierra On-Line during the company's golden age of adventure gaming, contributing to over 18 games across multiple Sierra franchises.[^ref-1] As a versatile systems programmer, Oldfield worked on major titles including the King's Quest, Space Quest, Police Quest, and Quest for Glory series, helping to implement Sierra's SCI engine across various platforms.[^ref-2] His programming credits span from 1988 through the mid-1990s, covering some of Sierra's most technically ambitious productions.

Beyond his programming work, Oldfield made a unique creative contribution to gaming history: his "Chicken Lander" program became the basis for the Astro Chicken minigame in Space Quest III: The Pirates of Pestulon, one of adventure gaming's most beloved Easter eggs.[^ref-3] His work exemplifies the collaborative nature of Sierra's development teams, where programmers often contributed beyond their technical roles.

## Career

### Sierra On-Line

Oldfield joined Sierra On-Line during the transition from AGI to SCI engine games, contributing to titles that helped define the adventure game genre.[^ref-1] His earliest credits include work on Manhunter: New York (1988) and Space Quest III (1989), where he helped program the Amiga and Atari ST conversions.[^ref-4]

During the early 1990s, Oldfield became a key member of Sierra's programming team, working on flagship titles including King's Quest IV, King's Quest V, and King's Quest VI.[^ref-1] His programming work helped realize Roberta Williams' increasingly ambitious vision for the series, from the VGA graphics of KQ5 to the lip-sync technology of KQ6.[^ref-5]

Oldfield frequently collaborated with other Sierra programmers including Pablo Ghenis, J. Mark Hood, and Robert Lindsley on major productions.[^ref-6] He served as lead programmer on Police Quest III: The Kindred (1991), demonstrating his advancement within Sierra's technical hierarchy.[^ref-1]

### Major Projects

His work on Codename: ICEMAN (1990) as lead programmer showcased his ability to handle complex simulation elements alongside adventure gameplay.[^ref-6] The game's submarine sequences required sophisticated programming to implement the realistic navigation systems that designer Jim Walls envisioned.[^ref-7]

Oldfield continued with Sierra through the mid-1990s, contributing to titles including Phantasmagoria, King's Quest VII, Police Quest: Open Season, Police Quest: SWAT, and Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire.[^ref-1] His later credits demonstrate the evolution of Sierra's technology from 2D adventure games to the more complex productions of the multimedia era.

## Notable Works

### Space Quest III: The Pirates of Pestulon (1989)

Oldfield's most famous contribution to [[1989 - Space Quest III - The Pirates of Pestulon\|Space Quest III]] came not from his programming duties but from his side project "Chicken Lander."[^ref-3] This lunar lander-style game became the inspiration for Astro Chicken, the arcade game hidden within Space Quest III that players must master to decode a secret message.[^ref-3] The minigame became one of Sierra's most memorable Easter eggs and demonstrates the creative freedom Sierra programmers enjoyed.

### King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder (1990)

On [[1990 - King's Quest V - Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder\|King's Quest V]], Oldfield worked alongside programmers Oliver Brelsford, Juan Carlos Escobar, Chris Hoyt, Raoul Said, and Robert Lindsley to implement Sierra's first fully VGA adventure game.[^ref-8] The technical challenges of the production included implementing the new point-and-click interface and supporting the hand-painted backgrounds that made KQ5 a visual landmark.

### King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow (1992)

Oldfield contributed programming to [[1992 - King's Quest VI - Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow\|King's Quest VI]], working with Randy MacNeill, Robert L. Mallory, Victor Sadauskas, and Carlo Escobar under lead programmer Robert Lindsley.[^ref-5] The game pushed Sierra's technology further with lip-sync animations and an expanded scope that made it one of the company's most ambitious productions.

### Conquests of Camelot: The Search for the Grail (1990)

On [[1990 - Conquests of Camelot - The Search for the Grail\|Conquests of Camelot]], Oldfield worked as part of the programming team led by David Slayback, alongside Robert Fischbach, Jerry Shaw, and Eric Hart.[^ref-9] The game featured Christy Marx's intricate Arthurian story and Peter Ledger's distinctive artwork.

### EcoQuest 2: Lost Secret of the Rainforest (1993)

Oldfield co-led programming on [[1993 - EcoQuest - Lost Secret of the Rainforest\|EcoQuest 2]] with Bob Fischbach, implementing the rainforest exploration and educational content that defined Sierra's environmental adventure series.[^ref-10]

## Legacy

Doug Oldfield's career at Sierra represents the unsung work of the programmers who brought designers' visions to life.[^ref-1] His 38 credits across 18 games demonstrate the breadth of Sierra's output during its peak years, and his transition from port programmer to lead programmer reflects the growth opportunities available within Sierra's structure.[^ref-1]

The Astro Chicken minigame remains his most visible creative contribution, preserved in gaming history as one of the era's most memorable hidden games.[^ref-3] Players continue to discover and appreciate this artifact of Sierra's playful development culture, where a programmer's side project could become an integral part of a beloved franchise.
