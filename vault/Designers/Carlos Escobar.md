# Carlos Escobar

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 12, 2026</small>

## Overview

Juan Carlos Escobar, commonly credited as Carlos Escobar or Carlo Escobar, was a programmer at Sierra On-Line from the late 1980s through the mid-1990s.[^ref-1] He was one of Sierra's most prolific programmers, contributing to over twenty titles spanning the company's major franchises including King's Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, Space Quest, Police Quest, and Quest for Glory.[^ref-2] Escobar was particularly known as [[Al Lowe]]'s "right hand man," working closely with Lowe on multiple Leisure Suit Larry games.[^ref-3]

Beyond his technical contributions, Escobar became a beloved figure at Sierra for his dry wit and sardonic humor. His colleagues collected his memorable one-liners into "Carlos Sez," a program created by fellow programmer Robert Lindsley that displayed random Escobar quotes—a tradition that became part of Sierra's internal culture.[^ref-3] Escobar also achieved a unique form of immortality in Sierra history through an in-joke in [[1988 - Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (in Several Wrong Places)\|Leisure Suit Larry 2]]: if Larry succeeds in seducing Maria the maid, her brother "Carlos" arrives and shoots him—a playful tribute from his colleagues.[^ref-4]

Escobar passed away on July 4, 2011.[^ref-5]

## Career

### Sierra On-Line (1987–1995)

Escobar joined Sierra On-Line during a period of significant technological transition, as the company moved from its AGI engine to the more powerful SCI platform.[^ref-1] His early work included porting [[1984 - King's Quest - Quest for the Crown\|King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown]] to the Apple IIGS in 1987, where Al Lowe composed the enhanced soundtrack while Escobar handled the programming.[^ref-6]

One of Escobar's most significant partnerships was with Al Lowe on the Leisure Suit Larry series. Beginning with [[1987 - Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards\|Leisure Suit Larry 1]] (1987), Escobar worked on nearly every Larry game through [[1993 - Leisure Suit Larry 6 - Shape Up or Slip Out\|Leisure Suit Larry 6]] (1993).[^ref-3] Steve Conrad, a fellow Sierra programmer, recalled that "Carlos was Al Lowe's right hand man" and described him as "such a funny guy and character" who "was one of the good guys."[^ref-5]

As Sierra expanded its development capabilities, Escobar became part of the core programming teams for major productions. His work on [[1990 - King's Quest V - Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder\|King's Quest V]] (1990) placed him among the programmers—including Oliver Brelsford, Doug Oldfield, Chris Hoyt, Raoul Said, and Robert Lindsley—who implemented Sierra's first fully VGA adventure game.[^ref-7] On [[1992 - King's Quest VI - Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow\|King's Quest VI]] (1992), Escobar continued his programming work under lead programmer Robert Lindsley.[^ref-8]

Escobar's versatility was evident in the range of projects he contributed to: from serious drama like [[1990 - Codename - Iceman\|Code-Name: Iceman]] (1989) to educational titles like [[1991 - Mixed-Up Mother Goose\|Mixed-Up Mother Goose]] (1991), from fantasy adventures like [[1991 - Conquests of the Longbow - The Legend of Robin Hood\|Conquests of the Longbow]] (1991) to sci-fi comedy in [[1991 - Space Quest IV - Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers\|Space Quest IV]] (1991).[^ref-2]

His final major credits at Sierra included [[1994 - King's Quest VII - The Princeless Bride\|King's Quest VII]] (1994) and [[1995 - Phantasmagoria\|Phantasmagoria]] (1995), Roberta Williams' ambitious horror adventure.[^ref-2]

### The "Carlos Sez" Legacy

Escobar's sardonic wit became legendary at Sierra. His colleagues collected his memorable quotes, and fellow programmer Robert Lindsley created a batch file that many Sierra employees ran in their autoexec.bat files—displaying a random "Carlos Says" quote every time they restarted their computers (which was frequently in that era).[^ref-3] Doug Oldfield later turned this into a more sophisticated program that "floated around the company for years, always bringing a smile to those who knew and loved Carlos."[^ref-3]

Classic "Carlos Says" quotes included:[^ref-3]
- "I'm sorry I'm doing such a poor job of pretending I'm listening."
- "You must have mistaken me for someone who cares."
- "There's a fine line between my friends… and the people I get stuck working with."
- "It's not magic, it's just code!"
- "I think the problem is between the chair and the keyboard."
- "Why be nice when you can be honest?"

## Notable Works

### King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown - Apple IIGS (1987)

Escobar's Apple IIGS port of [[1984 - King's Quest - Quest for the Crown\|King's Quest I]] featured extensive audio enhancements that took advantage of the IIGS's superior sound capabilities, with Al Lowe composing the enhanced music and sound effects.[^ref-6] This port demonstrated Escobar's ability to adapt Sierra's games to different hardware platforms while adding platform-specific improvements.

### Leisure Suit Larry Series (1987–1993)

As Al Lowe's primary programming collaborator, Escobar worked on [[1987 - Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards\|LSL1]], [[1988 - Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (in Several Wrong Places)\|LSL2]], [[1989 - Leisure Suit Larry III - Passionate Patti in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals\|LSL3]], [[1991 - Leisure Suit Larry 5 - Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work\|LSL5]], and [[1993 - Leisure Suit Larry 6 - Shape Up or Slip Out\|LSL6]].[^ref-3] The "Carlos" death scene in LSL2, where Maria's brother shoots Larry, remains one of Sierra's most memorable programmer Easter eggs.[^ref-4]

### King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder (1990)

As part of the programming team for [[1990 - King's Quest V - Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder\|King's Quest V]], Escobar helped implement Sierra's revolutionary VGA adventure game.[^ref-7] The game marked Sierra's first use of 256-color graphics and a point-and-click interface, requiring careful programming to manage the increased visual complexity.

### King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow (1992)

On [[1992 - King's Quest VI - Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow\|King's Quest VI]], Escobar contributed to what is widely considered the finest entry in Sierra's flagship adventure series.[^ref-8] His programming work helped realize the game's multiple endings, complex puzzle systems, and the technically demanding Land of the Dead sequences.

### Phantasmagoria (1995)

Escobar's final major Sierra credit was [[1995 - Phantasmagoria\|Phantasmagoria]], Roberta Williams' controversial horror adventure that pushed the boundaries of interactive storytelling with live-action video.[^ref-2]

## Legacy

Carlos Escobar's career at Sierra illustrates the crucial role of programmers in bringing designers' visions to life during adventure gaming's golden age.[^ref-1] His work on major franchises helped establish the technical foundations for Sierra's most celebrated productions.

The "Carlos Sez" program represents the collegial atmosphere at Sierra during this period, where developers created inside jokes that became part of company culture.[^ref-3] When news of his passing circulated among former Sierra employees, the outpouring of memories testified to his impact on those who worked alongside him. As Josh Mandel wrote simply: "I loved Carlos. Really loved him."[^ref-5]

Bridget McKenna recalled: "He was such a character, and so much a part of our everyday life at Sierra. During our Sierra days, Marti and I wrote a story and put a character in it—a programmer—who said things like 'They don't pay me enough to think.' That was one of our favorite 'Carlos says' lines. Carlos, you could always make us laugh, and that was—and is—valuable beyond measure."[^ref-5]
