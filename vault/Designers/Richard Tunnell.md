Following his time at Dynamix, Tunnell continued his career in game development at GarageGames, Playdom, and eventually Zynga, where he served as Lead Game Designer.[^ref-3] His progression from quality assurance and additional design roles at Dynamix to lead designer positions at major social gaming companies reflects the broader evolution of the gaming industry from traditional PC games to social and mobile platforms.

## Career

### Early Career

Richard Tunnell began his game development career at Dynamix, the Eugene, Oregon-based studio co-founded by his brother Jeff Tunnell and Damon Slye in 1984.[^ref-4] His early work at the company included quality assurance and additional design contributions, allowing him to learn the development process while supporting the studio's growing catalog of games. This hands-on approach to entering the industry was common during the era when game development teams were smaller and roles were less rigidly defined.

### Dynamix Years

During his tenure at Dynamix, Tunnell contributed to several of the studio's most commercially successful projects.[^ref-1] His work on The Incredible Machine 2 (1994) and The Incredible Toon Machine (1994) helped extend one of Jeff Tunnell Productions' most beloved franchises. He also contributed to 3-D Ultra Pinball (1995), which launched another successful Sierra casual gaming series.[^ref-5]

Tunnell's credits at Dynamix spanned both the company's simulation era and its transition to casual gaming under Sierra's ownership.[^ref-2] His involvement with Trophy Bass (1995) as a quality analyst demonstrated his versatility, contributing to a fishing simulation that became one of Sierra Sports' biggest sellers. Later entries in The Incredible Machine series, including Return of The Incredible Machine: Contraptions (2000) and The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions (2001), featured his continued design contributions.[^ref-6]

### Later Career

After Dynamix's closure, Tunnell transitioned to new opportunities in the evolving game industry.[^ref-3] He worked at GarageGames, continuing his connection to the indie and casual gaming space. His subsequent move to Playdom and then Zynga marked his entry into social gaming, where he rose to the position of Lead Game Designer. This career trajectory reflected the industry's shift toward social and mobile platforms during the 2010s.
