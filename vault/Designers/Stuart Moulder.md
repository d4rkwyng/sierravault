## Career

### Sierra Years (1990–1993)

Moulder began his game industry career at Sierra On-Line, where he quickly established himself as a capable producer on some of the company's most beloved titles.[^ref-1] His work on [[1990 - Mixed-Up Mother Goose (SCI Remake)\|Mixed-Up Mother Goose]] proved particularly significant, as this children's game became Sierra's first CD-ROM release—a technological milestone that anticipated the industry's shift from floppy disks to optical media.[^ref-2]

At Sierra, Moulder's production credits spanned multiple franchises including King's Quest, Space Quest, Quest for Glory, Leisure Suit Larry, and the Dr. Brain educational series.[^ref-3] He produced the VGA remakes of [[1991 - Space Quest I - Roger Wilco in the Sarien Encounter\|Space Quest I]] and [[1992 - Quest for Glory I - So You Want to Be a Hero VGA\|Quest for Glory I]], helping shepherd Sierra's classic parser-driven adventures into the point-and-click era. His involvement with [[1991 - Castle of Dr. Brain\|Castle of Dr. Brain]] (1991) demonstrated his ability to manage educational titles alongside entertainment products.[^ref-7]

Beyond production, Moulder contributed creatively to Sierra productions.

### Microsoft Game Studios (1995–2004)

In 1995, Moulder joined Microsoft Game Studios, beginning a tenure that would see him credited on over 40 titles across nearly a decade.[^ref-2] His initial role as Product Unit Manager evolved into broader responsibilities as General Manager for PC Games, overseeing some of the company's most successful franchises.[^ref-9]

Moulder's work at Microsoft touched an impressive range of projects. On the Age of Empires series, he served as Product Unit Manager beginning with the original 1997 release, working alongside Ensemble Studios.[^ref-3] His contributions continued through Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings (1999), The Conquerors expansion (2000), and Age of Mythology (2002). The credits list him under the nickname "Yoda," reflecting his mentorship role with development teams—a designation that would persist in Age of Empires credits through the 2024 Age of Mythology: Retold release.[^ref-4]

For the Close Combat series with Atomic Games, Moulder served as Microsoft's Joint Chief of Staff and Product Unit Manager across all three original entries.[^ref-3] He contributed historical text to Close Combat III: The Russian Front (1999), demonstrating expertise beyond pure management—notably, he holds a degree in history.[^ref-6] 

As General Manager, Moulder oversaw Microsoft's simulation portfolio including Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 (2001), Flight Simulator 2004: A Century of Flight (2003), and Microsoft Train Simulator (2001).[^ref-3] He also managed the launch of Zoo Tycoon (2001) and its Complete Collection, MechCommander 2 (2001), RalliSport Challenge (2002), and Combat Flight Simulator 3 (2002).

Moulder's tenure coincided with Microsoft's acquisition of several game studios, and he worked on titles from multiple acquired developers. He provided production support on Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone (2004) and received special thanks credits on numerous first-party titles including Halo: Combat Evolved (2001), Halo 2 (2004), Dungeon Siege (2002), and Asheron's Call 2 (2002).[^ref-3] The breadth of his credits reflects the collaborative environment at Microsoft Game Studios where senior managers supported projects across the organization.

### Screenlife and Scene It? (2005–2009)

After leaving Microsoft, Moulder focused on casual and family gaming.[^ref-2] He worked with Screenlife, the creator of the Scene It? DVD movie trivia game franchise, serving as SVP of Strategy and Architecture.[^ref-3] During this period, he was credited as Executive Producer on Scene It? Box Office Smash! (2008) for Xbox 360 and Scene It? The Simpsons (2009).[^ref-3]

### Gazillion Entertainment (2009–2011)

Moulder joined Gazillion Entertainment, an online game developer specializing in massively multiplayer games for family audiences.[^ref-5] His work there included LEGO Universe and Marvel Super Hero Squad Online (2011), continuing his focus on family-friendly gaming experiences.[^ref-2] This role expanded his understanding of games-as-a-service models and online gaming operations.

### Her Interactive (2011–2015)

On May 16, 2011, Moulder joined Her Interactive as CEO, tasked with corporate strategy and day-to-day operations for the Nancy Drew game developer.[^ref-10] The company had established itself as a leading creator of games targeting female audiences through 25 Nancy Drew mystery adventure games, and Moulder brought his extensive production background to guide its evolution.

Working alongside former CEO Megan Gaiser, who transitioned to Chief Creative Strategy Officer, Moulder led Her Interactive through a critical period of industry transition.[^ref-5] Under his leadership, the company successfully moved from physical to digital distribution, a significant operational transformation that reflected broader industry trends.[^ref-6] The company achieved record sales during his tenure, demonstrating effective management of the transition.

Moulder served as CEO and Executive Producer on five Nancy Drew titles: Alibi in Ashes (2011), Tomb of the Lost Queen (2012), Labyrinth of Lies (2014), The Silent Spy (2015), and The Shattered Medallion (2017).[^ref-3] Nancy Drew: Alibi in Ashes marked the series' 25th installment and introduced the ability to play as Nancy's friends Ned, Bess, and George—a significant gameplay evolution for the franchise.[^ref-5]

Moulder brought a personal connection to Her Interactive's mission, noting in interviews that he had a 10-year-old daughter he was "working hard to raise the right way – as a gamer" and had a stake in making games for girls.[^ref-5] He departed the company when Penny Milliken, who had served on the Board of Directors since 2003, assumed the CEO role.[^ref-11]

### Boom Learning (2018–Present)

In May 2018, Moulder became CEO of Boom Learning, an educational technology company providing a cloud-based platform for teacher-created digital resources.[^ref-6] The role extended his trajectory from game production to company leadership, applying lessons learned across decades of industry experience to new challenges in educational technology.

At Boom Learning, Moulder oversees a platform that allows teachers to create self-grading, interactive digital lessons without coding knowledge—similar in philosophy to the accessible game creation tools he worked with throughout his career.[^ref-6] The company noted his "great history of building engaging products for kids" and his experience with subscription and microtransaction markets as key qualifications for the role.[^ref-6]

### Legacy Credits (2013–2024)

Despite leaving Microsoft in 2004, Moulder continues to receive credits on Age of Empires franchise releases as part of the original team's acknowledgment.[^ref-3] These include Age of Empires II: HD Edition (2013), Age of Empires: Definitive Edition (2018), Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition (2019), and Age of Mythology: Retold (2024)—testament to the lasting significance of his contributions to the franchise.[^ref-4]

## Notable Works

### Mixed-Up Mother Goose (CD-ROM) (1991)

[[1990 - Mixed-Up Mother Goose (SCI Remake)\|Mixed-Up Mother Goose]] became Sierra's first CD-ROM release under Moulder's production, establishing a milestone in the company's technological evolution.[^ref-2] The transition to optical media allowed for enhanced audio including voice acting—a feature that would become standard in adventure games. This production demonstrated Moulder's ability to shepherd technically ambitious projects that anticipated industry trends.

### Age of Empires (1997)

As Product Unit Manager on the original Age of Empires, Moulder helped oversee Microsoft's entry into the real-time strategy genre—a game that would spawn one of gaming's most enduring franchises.[^ref-3] The title established Ensemble Studios as a premier RTS developer and laid the foundation for Age of Empires II, often considered one of the greatest strategy games ever made.

### Close Combat Series (1996–1999)

Moulder's work on the Close Combat series showcased his range beyond fantasy and science fiction. Serving as Joint Chief of Staff and Product Unit Manager across all three original games, he contributed historical text to Close Combat III: The Russian Front, bringing his degree in history to bear on the series' commitment to accuracy.[^ref-3] The real-time tactical wargames earned critical acclaim for their authentic depiction of World War II combat.

### Nancy Drew: Tomb of the Lost Queen (2012)

As CEO and Executive Producer on [[Nancy Drew: Tomb of the Lost Queen]], Moulder led Her Interactive's 26th Nancy Drew title, which featured an Egyptian archaeological mystery.[^ref-3] The game demonstrated the franchise's continued commercial viability under digital distribution and showcased the company's ability to maintain production values during a significant business model transition.

## Design Philosophy

Moulder's career reflects an understanding that successful game development requires both creative vision and operational excellence. His progression from producer to CEO demonstrates the importance of business acumen alongside creative skills in the maturing game industry. At Her Interactive, he emphasized that "the focus of our games is the mystery and that will always be the case," showing respect for established franchise identity even while driving business transformation.[^ref-5]

His approach to product management involved deep engagement with development teams—evidenced by the "Yoda" nickname acknowledging his mentorship role on Age of Empires projects.[^ref-4] The special thanks credits he received from developers across Microsoft Game Studios, from Bungie (Halo) to Gas Powered Games (Dungeon Siege), suggest a management style that earned genuine appreciation from development partners.[^ref-12]

## Legacy

Stuart Moulder's career bridges multiple eras of gaming: the Sierra adventure game golden age, Microsoft's rise as a PC gaming powerhouse, and the industry's transition to digital distribution. His production credits span educational children's games, hardcore strategy simulations, and mystery adventures—demonstrating remarkable versatility across the medium.

His contribution to Sierra's first CD-ROM release marked an early milestone in gaming's shift to optical media, while his digital distribution work at Her Interactive over two decades later showed continued adaptation to industry evolution.[^ref-2] The Age of Empires franchise credits spanning 1997 to 2024 represent one of the longest associations between an individual and a major gaming franchise, even as his direct involvement ended years earlier.[^ref-4]

At Her Interactive, Moulder helped ensure the Nancy Drew franchise's survival into the streaming era, maintaining a major gaming franchise targeting female audiences during a period when such games faced increasing commercial pressure.[^ref-6] His later work at Boom Learning continues his career-long engagement with educational content, echoing his Sierra productions of Dr. Brain and Mixed-Up Mother Goose decades earlier.
