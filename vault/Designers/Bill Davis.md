<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 14, 2026</small>

## Overview

William Robert Davis (born May 1949) is an Emmy Award-winning American illustrator, animation director, graphic designer, and game industry pioneer who served as Vice President of Development and Creative Director at Sierra On-Line from 1989 to 1996.[^ref-1] His arrival at Sierra marked a turning point in the company's approach to game development, as he introduced Hollywood production techniques including storyboarding, rotoscoping, and advanced animation methods that transformed the artistic quality of Sierra's games during their golden age.[^ref-2]

Before entering the game industry, Davis had established himself in broadcast television as lead graphic designer at NBC, where he won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Graphic Design and Title Sequences for his work on NBC's "The First 50 Years: A Closer Look" in 1978.[^ref-3] He also created over 200 "More to Come" slides for The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and designed the logo for The Gong Show.[^ref-4] This background in professional animation and broadcast design uniquely positioned him to elevate Sierra's visual standards during the company's transition to CD-ROM and VGA technology.

## Career

### Early Career

Davis was born in May 1949 in downtown Los Angeles and raised in the coastal community of Venice.[^ref-5] Coming from a family with strong artistic traditions—both his mother and maternal grandfather were artists—Davis pursued formal training at the California Institute of the Arts, graduating in 1971 with a BFA degree and high honors.[^ref-5]

His television career began at NBC, where he served as lead graphic designer and earned recognition for his animated title sequences.[^ref-3] The Emmy Award he received in 1978 acknowledged his ability to combine animation, design, and storytelling in ways that would later prove invaluable in game development. After NBC, Davis worked as an animation director and designer for Kurtz & Friends, further developing his expertise in traditional animation techniques.[^ref-1]

### Sierra Years

In July 1989, Ken Williams recruited Davis from Hollywood to serve as Vice President of Development and Sierra's first Creative Director.[^ref-6] By the late 1980s, Sierra had embraced emerging technologies including CD-ROMs, sound cards, and VGA displays, which allowed games to achieve theatrical quality similar to animated or live-action films. Davis was brought in to adapt Hollywood creative approaches and production techniques to these new capabilities.[^ref-2]

During his tenure, Davis introduced storyboarding—a method adapted from film production—into Sierra's game development process.[^ref-7] This technique improved planning and execution, leading to more consistent and visually engaging games while facilitating team expansion without proportionately extending project timelines. He brought traditional media such as painting and sculpting into Sierra's game design, moving away from the prevalent low-resolution digital creation methods. Under his direction, artists drew backgrounds and animations by hand before scanning them into games, achieving sharper, more realistic visuals.[^ref-2]

Davis introduced advanced animation techniques including rotoscoping and squash and stretch to improve the realism and expressiveness of character movements.[^ref-7] Recognizing the need for structured visual oversight, he established the role of art director at Sierra to unify the visual components of games. He also initiated outsourcing animation work to international studios—a practice borrowed from the traditional animation industry but relatively new to video games at the time.[^ref-2]

His credits at Sierra span many of the company's most acclaimed titles from this era, including King's Quest V, Space Quest IV, Jones in the Fast Lane, the Leisure Suit Larry series, Police Quest III, Quest for Glory II and III, EcoQuest, Conquests of the Longbow, and both Dr. Brain games.[^ref-8]

### Later Career

After departing Sierra in 1996, Davis served as Creative Director at Rocket Science Games, continuing to apply his production expertise to the gaming industry.[^ref-1] He later founded Mother Productions, a graphic design firm creating animation, motion graphics, logos, and other graphic designs for on-air and online purposes.[^ref-9]

Since the 2000s, Davis has maintained an active fine art practice under the artistic persona Trowzers Akimbo, creating landscape paintings primarily focused on Yosemite National Park and the surrounding Sierra Nevada region.[^ref-10]

## Notable Works

### King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder (1990)

[[1990 - King's Quest V - Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder\|King's Quest V]] showcased the production improvements Davis brought to Sierra, with enhanced animation quality and visual consistency that set new standards for the franchise.[^ref-8] The game's VGA graphics demonstrated the benefits of Davis's approach to art direction.

### Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers (1991)

[[1991 - Space Quest IV - Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers\|Space Quest IV]] benefited from Davis's animation expertise, featuring more expressive character movements and improved visual storytelling.[^ref-8] The game's time-traveling narrative allowed for varied visual environments that demonstrated the flexibility of Davis's production methods.

### Jones in the Fast Lane (1991)

[[1990 - Jones in the Fast Lane\|Jones in the Fast Lane]] was illustrated by Davis himself, showcasing the rotoscoping and storyboarding techniques he had introduced to Sierra.[^ref-7] The Spring 1991 edition of Sierra Magazine featured Davis's cover illustration for the game, highlighting his hands-on artistic contributions alongside his management role.

### Slater & Charlie Go Camping (1993)

[[1993 - Slater & Charlie Go Camping\|Slater & Charlie Go Camping]] represented one of Davis's most comprehensive creative involvements, with credits for writing, directing, producing, art direction, character design, and gag writing.[^ref-8] This children's title demonstrated his versatility across multiple aspects of game development.

## Design Philosophy

Davis's approach to game development emphasized the application of proven film and television production techniques to the emerging medium of video games.[^ref-2] His introduction of storyboarding reflected a belief that games should be planned with the same rigor as animated films, with clear visual direction established before production began. This philosophy improved both the quality and efficiency of Sierra's development process.

His advocacy for traditional artistic techniques—hand-drawn animations and backgrounds, rotoscoping for realistic movement—represented a conscious choice to elevate game graphics beyond the limitations of purely digital creation methods available at the time.[^ref-7] Davis understood that the transition to VGA and CD-ROM technology created an opportunity to bring cinematic quality to games, and he worked to ensure Sierra seized that opportunity.

## Legacy

Bill Davis's tenure at Sierra On-Line represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of video game production.[^ref-2] By importing established Hollywood techniques into game development, he helped transform Sierra's approach from programmer-centric to production-oriented, establishing practices that would become industry standards. His creation of the art director role and initiation of international animation outsourcing anticipated the globalized, specialized production pipelines that characterize modern game development.[^ref-6]

The visual quality improvements visible in Sierra's games from 1990 onwards reflect Davis's influence, as the company's titles achieved a level of artistic polish that distinguished them from competitors.[^ref-8] His Emmy Award-winning background brought credibility and expertise that helped legitimize video games as a visual medium worthy of serious artistic attention.
