## Career

### Early Career (Pre-1989)

David Selle's entry into the video game industry began in 1989 when he was hired by Dynamix, the Eugene, Oregon-based game development studio known for its innovative simulation and adventure games.[^ref-1] His educational background includes studies at the University of Washington, where he later obtained a Software Product Manager certification, and training at Nintendo's DigiPen Institute's game projects division.[^ref-6] This technical foundation would prove invaluable throughout his career in game development and later business ventures.

Selle's first projects at Dynamix involved contributing to existing franchises and learning the craft of game design through hands-on experience.[^ref-7] His early work included track designs and documentation for Motocross in 1989, followed by mission design and documentation work on [[1991 - A-10 Tank Killer v1.5\|A-10 Tank Killer]], also in 1989.[^ref-8] These initial assignments allowed him to understand the technical and creative challenges of game development while working alongside experienced designers and programmers.

### Dynamix Years (1989–1999)

During his ten years and three months at Dynamix, Selle worked on some of the most memorable games of the 1990s, contributing to both the company's adventure game legacy and pioneering work in mech simulation.[^ref-1] His writing talents became evident early in his tenure, contributing dialogue and text to [[1990 - Rise of the Dragon\|Rise of the Dragon]] in 1990, a cyberpunk adventure that showcased Dynamix's storytelling capabilities.[^ref-9] He continued developing his narrative skills with writer and world design credits on [[1991 - Nova 9 - The Return of Gir Draxon\|Nova 9: The Return of Gir Draxon]] in 1991.[^ref-10]

One of Selle's most significant contributions during this period was his work on [[1991 - The Adventures of Willy Beamish\|The Adventures of Willy Beamish]] in 1991, where he served as both writer and manual writer for this beloved coming-of-age adventure game.[^ref-11] The game's success demonstrated his ability to craft engaging narratives that resonated with players and critics alike. His versatility was further showcased when he took on the role of assistant director and additional writer for [[1993 - Space Quest V - The Next Mutation\|Space Quest V: The Next Mutation]] in 1993, working on one of Sierra's most popular comedy adventure franchises.[^ref-12]

The pinnacle of Selle's creative achievements at Dynamix came with his role as co-creator and designer of the EarthSiege and Starsiege universe, beginning with [[1994 - Metaltech - Earthsiege\|Metaltech: EarthSiege]] in 1994.[^ref-13] This groundbreaking mech simulation game established a new standard for robot combat games, featuring detailed mechs called HERCs (Human Operated Remote Combatants) and a complex narrative involving humanity's struggle against artificial intelligence. Selle's design work on the game included not only gameplay mechanics but also the rich lore and universe that would support multiple sequels and expansions.[^ref-14]

### Post-Dynamix Career (1999–Present)

After leaving Dynamix in November 1999, Selle transitioned into broader technology and business roles while maintaining connections to the gaming industry.[^ref-15] In 2007, he worked on video content for Uncharted: Drake's Fortune at Sony Computer Entertainment America, contributing to what would become one of PlayStation's flagship franchises.[^ref-16] This role demonstrated his ability to adapt his storytelling and design skills to new gaming platforms and technologies.

Selle subsequently led the Custom Publishing Group at WildStudios, where he developed award-winning "Advergame" content for major corporate clients including Nike, Coca-Cola, Visa, DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Pepsi.[^ref-17] This work showcased his ability to apply game design principles to marketing and promotional content, creating engaging interactive experiences for brand promotion. His success in this field earned him recognition as a pioneer in the branded gaming space.

More recently, Selle has taken on educational roles, including teaching positions at Nintendo's DigiPen Institute and Harvard University Graduate School of Design.[^ref-18] As he noted in a recent LinkedIn post, "Yesterday was my first class of the semester teaching at Harvard University Graduate School of Design GSD, and it felt wonderful!" This transition to education reflects his commitment to mentoring the next generation of designers and developers.[^ref-19] He has also worked as Vice President of Business Development at Nyriad, applying his technical and creative expertise to enterprise technology solutions.[^ref-20]

## Notable Works

### Metaltech: EarthSiege (1994)

[[1994 - Metaltech - Earthsiege\|Metaltech: EarthSiege]] stands as David Selle's most influential creation, establishing him as co-creator of the EarthSiege universe and pioneering the modern mech simulation genre.[^ref-21] The game featured unprecedented detail in its mech customization system, allowing players to configure their HERCs with various weapons, armor configurations, and equipment loadouts. Selle's design philosophy emphasized tactical combat over arcade-style action, requiring players to manage heat buildup, ammunition conservation, and strategic positioning.[^ref-22] The game's narrative, set in a future where humanity battles against the GAIA AI system, provided a compelling backdrop that elevated the combat beyond simple robot battles to a story of survival and technological hubris.[^ref-23]

### EarthSiege 2 (1996)

Building on the foundation established in the original game, [[1996 - Earthsiege 2\|EarthSiege 2]] saw Selle refining and expanding his vision for mech-based combat simulation.[^ref-24] The sequel featured enhanced graphics, more sophisticated AI opponents, and an expanded arsenal of mechs and weapons. Selle's design improvements included better mission variety, more intuitive controls, and enhanced multiplayer capabilities that would influence future networked gaming experiences.[^ref-25] The game's reception among critics and players solidified the EarthSiege franchise as a premier destination for mech simulation enthusiasts and demonstrated Selle's growth as both a designer and project leader.[^ref-26]

### Starsiege (1999)

[[1999 - Starsiege\|Starsiege]] represented the culmination of Selle's work on the EarthSiege universe, serving as both a prequel and spiritual successor to the earlier games.[^ref-27] As his final major project at Dynamix before departing in November 1999, Starsiege showcased his mature design sensibilities and understanding of what made mech combat engaging for players. The game featured three distinct factions with unique mech designs and combat philosophies, demonstrating Selle's ability to create varied gameplay experiences within a unified design framework.[^ref-28] Starsiege also served as the foundation for the wildly successful multiplayer spin-off Starsiege: Tribes, though Selle's direct involvement in that project was limited due to his departure from Dynamix.[^ref-29]

## Design Philosophy

Selle's approach to game design reflects a deep commitment to player empowerment and technological innovation, as evidenced by his personal statement: "I love learning new technology, creating with digital tools, and empowering others."[^ref-30] Throughout his career, this philosophy manifested in games that provided players with extensive customization options and strategic depth rather than limiting them to predetermined paths. His work on the EarthSiege series exemplified this approach, offering complex mech configuration systems that allowed players to experiment with different tactical approaches.[^ref-31]

Professional colleagues have consistently praised Selle's collaborative approach and attention to detail. As one recommendation noted, "I have worked with David for many years and know him to be a person of high integrity with an incredible work ethic. He is an innovative thinker that consistently delivers an experience that is mutually beneficial to both the client and his company."[^ref-32] This collaborative spirit extended to his work with writing teams on adventure games, where he contributed dialogue and narrative elements that enhanced the overall player experience without overwhelming the core gameplay mechanics.[^ref-33]

## Legacy

David Selle's impact on the gaming industry extends far beyond his individual game credits, particularly through his co-creation of the EarthSiege and Starsiege universe, which influenced an entire generation of mech simulation games.[^ref-34] The design principles he established in the EarthSiege series—emphasizing tactical depth, customization options, and narrative integration—became standard features in subsequent mech games and influenced the broader simulation genre. His work at Dynamix during the 1990s contributed to the studio's reputation as one of the premier development houses for both adventure games and simulations.[^ref-35]

Beyond gaming, Selle has received recognition for his contributions to education and community service, including the Presidential Volunteer Service Award in 2012 from Citizen Schools, a Silver Pin from the Museum of Science Boston in 2014, and Distinguished Employee Recognition awards from The Possible Project in both 2015 and 2017.[^ref-36] His transition to teaching roles at prestigious institutions like Harvard University Graduate School of Design demonstrates his commitment to sharing knowledge and mentoring future creators.[^ref-37]

Selle's influence continues through his educational work and business development activities, where he applies game design principles to new challenges and technologies. His SCRUM practitioner certification from the Agile Software Alliance and Software Product Manager certification from the University of Washington show his commitment to staying current with industry best practices.[^ref-38] As the gaming industry continues to evolve, Selle's emphasis on player empowerment and technological innovation remains relevant for contemporary designers and developers.[^ref-39]
