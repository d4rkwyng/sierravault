<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 12, 2026</small>

## Overview

Lori Ann Cole (born May 5, 1965) is a pioneering video game designer best known for co-creating the groundbreaking Quest for Glory series alongside her husband Corey Cole.[^ref-1] Born into a generation that would witness the birth of personal computing, Cole's journey into game design was unconventional, beginning as a school teacher in Arizona before finding her calling in the emerging interactive entertainment industry.[^ref-2] Her unique background in education and deep passion for fantasy literature and tabletop role-playing games would prove instrumental in shaping her revolutionary approach to game design.

Cole's most significant contribution to gaming history lies in her pioneering work on the Quest for Glory series, which successfully merged adventure game storytelling with role-playing game mechanics.[^ref-3] As she explained her design philosophy: "to bring storytelling and [the] interesting plot lines of books and tabletop role-playing into the hack-and-slash thrill of a computer game."[^ref-4] This innovative hybrid approach not only created a new subgenre but also established templates for character progression, moral decision-making, and narrative depth that would influence game design for decades to come.[^ref-5] Her work emphasized the educational potential of gaming, reflecting her teaching background and belief that "the QFG series requires that a player think about what he is doing and have to make moral decisions."[^ref-6]

## Career

### Early Career

Lori Ann Cole's path to game design began far from Silicon Valley, in the world of education where she worked as a school teacher in Arizona.[^ref-7] Her early experiences in education would later profoundly influence her approach to game design, particularly her emphasis on moral decision-making and character development within interactive narratives.[^ref-8] "As a child, I always wanted to be a teacher," Cole recalled, explaining how this desire manifested in her later game design philosophy where "The QFG series requires that a player think about what he is doing and have to make moral decisions. The player really becomes a Hero through the course of play, and hopefully carries some of the concepts of heroism onward in real life."[^ref-9]

Cole's introduction to the gaming world came through her deep involvement in tabletop role-playing games and fantasy literature. "I have been a reader and a lover of fantasy and mythology most of my life. I've also been a game player and a role player," she noted.[^ref-10] Her entry into the video game industry was facilitated by her relationship with Corey Cole, whom she met at a Dungeons & Dragons game at Westercon in San Francisco during the summer of 1979.[^ref-11] Together, they co-edited "The Spellbook," a newsletter for tabletop-RPG aficionados, demonstrating their shared passion for gaming and storytelling long before entering the computer game industry.[^ref-12]

### Sierra Years

Cole joined Sierra On-Line in 1988, initially skeptical about computer games' ability to match the depth and freedom of tabletop RPGs.[^ref-13] "Like many dedicated players of tabletop RPGs, she always felt the computerized variety to be lacking in texture, story, and most of all freedom," as gaming historian Jimmy Maher observed.[^ref-14] However, this skepticism would prove to be her greatest asset, driving her to create games that addressed these very limitations. "I really enjoyed RPG games, and had never really played an adventure game before working for Sierra. Unfortunately, most computer RPG's at the time were all monster crawls and very little real role-playing. I wanted to play a game with story and characters," Cole explained.[^ref-15]

In 1989, Cole co-designed Hero's Quest I: So You Want to Be a Hero (later renamed Quest for Glory I due to trademark issues), which would become her defining work.[^ref-16] The game represented a revolutionary fusion of adventure game storytelling with RPG character development and progression systems. The innovative approach earned the game the Adventure Game of the Year award from Computer Gaming World.[^ref-17] Cole's design philosophy extended beyond mere gameplay mechanics to encompass moral and ethical dimensions, as evidenced in her conception of the Paladin class: "My concept of Paladin was slightly different. A Paladin was someone who does what is right regardless of the laws or other people's opinion."[^ref-18]

The success of the first game led to Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire in 1990, though development proved more challenging due to Sierra's changing development methodologies.[^ref-19] "We got the worst of both worlds. We got a new [development] system that had never been tried before, and all the bugs that went with that. And we were under the old-school technology where the colors weren't as good and all that. We were under a new administration with a different way of tr[eating projects]," Cole recalled about the difficult production period.[^ref-20] Despite these challenges, the series continued to grow and evolve through Quest for Glory III: Wages of War (1992), Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness (1993), and ultimately Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire (1998).[^ref-21]

### Later Career

Following Sierra's restructuring in 1999, which Cole and many Sierra veterans viewed unfavorably, she transitioned away from mainstream game development.[^ref-22] When asked "Do you miss working for Sierra On-Line?" she responded emphatically: "Not in the least. ;-)"[^ref-23] However, her passion for game design and storytelling never waned. Cole continued to work on various projects and maintained active engagement with the gaming community through interviews, fan interactions, and development of new concepts.[^ref-24]

In recent years, Cole has expressed interest in returning to the Quest for Glory universe, with reports indicating "she would like to buy the rights to the Hero Quest/Quest for Glory games" to regain creative control over her seminal work.[^ref-25] She has also been involved in spiritual successors to her classic games, including Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption (2018) and Summer Daze: Tilly's Tale (2023), continuing to explore themes of character development, moral choice, and educational gaming.[^ref-26] Her ongoing project, the "How To Be a Hero" website, reflects her continued commitment to the educational and moral dimensions of interactive entertainment.[^ref-27]

## Notable Works

### Quest for Glory I: So You Want to Be a Hero (1989)

Cole's masterpiece, originally titled Hero's Quest I, represented a paradigm shift in computer gaming by successfully merging adventure game storytelling with RPG character progression.[^ref-1] Her innovative design allowed players to choose from three distinct character classes—Fighter, Magic User, and Thief—each offering unique solutions to the game's challenges and different narrative experiences.[^ref-2] The game's revolutionary character import system, which allowed players to transfer their developed characters to subsequent games in the series, was unprecedented in the industry and became a defining feature of the franchise.[^ref-3] The title earned the Adventure Game of the Year award from Computer Gaming World, validating Cole's vision of hybrid gameplay.[^ref-4]

### Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire (1990)

The sequel showcased Cole's commitment to cultural diversity and authentic world-building, transporting players to the Arabian Nights-inspired city of Shapeir.[^ref-5] Despite facing significant technical challenges with Sierra's new development systems, Cole maintained the series' core philosophy of meaningful choice and character development.[^ref-6] The game expanded upon the moral complexity introduced in the first installment, featuring more nuanced ethical dilemmas and deeper character interactions that reflected Cole's educational background and commitment to meaningful gameplay.[^ref-7]

### Quest for Glory III: Wages of War (1992)

Cole's exploration of African-inspired cultures in the third installment demonstrated her dedication to representing diverse mythologies and worldviews in gaming.[^ref-8] The game tackled complex themes of tribal conflict, diplomacy, and cultural understanding, reflecting Cole's belief that games could serve as vehicles for exploring real-world issues.[^ref-9] Her design philosophy of promoting heroism through moral choice reached new heights in this installment, where players' decisions significantly impacted the resolution of inter-tribal conflicts and the fate of entire communities.[^ref-10]

## Design Philosophy

Cole's approach to game design was fundamentally shaped by her background in education and her deep appreciation for fantasy literature and tabletop role-playing games.[^ref-11] She viewed games as powerful educational tools that could teach moral reasoning and character development. "The player really becomes a Hero through the course of play, and hopefully carries some of the concepts of heroism onward in real life," she explained, highlighting her belief in gaming's transformative potential.[^ref-12] This philosophy manifested in gameplay mechanics that rewarded altruistic behavior, encouraged ethical decision-making, and promoted understanding of diverse cultures and perspectives.[^ref-13]

Her design methodology emphasized player agency and meaningful choice, rejecting the linear progression typical of many contemporary games.[^ref-14] Cole believed that "most computer RPG's at the time were all monster crawls and very little real role-playing," leading her to create games that prioritized character development over combat mechanics.[^ref-15] Her innovative approach to character classes and problem-solving reflected her understanding that different players approached challenges in different ways, and that games should accommodate and celebrate this diversity.[^ref-16]

## Legacy

Lori Ann Cole's impact on the gaming industry extends far beyond her direct contributions to individual titles. Her pioneering work on the Quest for Glory series established the template for adventure-RPG hybrid games that continues to influence developers today.[^ref-17] The series' emphasis on character progression, moral choice, and narrative depth helped elevate gaming from simple entertainment to meaningful interactive storytelling.[^ref-18] As one fan expressed in a Reddit AMA: "thank you both so much for basically defining my childhood," reflecting the profound personal impact her games had on players.[^ref-19]

Cole's commitment to cultural diversity and authentic representation in game worlds predated many contemporary discussions about inclusivity in gaming.[^ref-20] Her thoughtful incorporation of various mythologies and cultural traditions demonstrated how games could serve as bridges between different worldviews while maintaining respect and authenticity. Her educational philosophy and emphasis on moral development through gameplay helped establish gaming's potential as a tool for personal growth and learning, influencing educators and designers who recognized the medium's pedagogical possibilities.[^ref-21]
