# Rabih AbouJaoudé

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 30, 2026</small>

## Overview

Rabih AbouJaoudé is a game designer and artist who built a prolific career at Sierra Entertainment, specializing in the Hoyle series of card, board, and puzzle games.[^ref-1] With 60 credits across 34 games spanning from 1995 to 2010, AbouJaoudé served in multiple capacities including Designer, Art Director, Lead Artist, and 3D Illustrator.[^ref-1] His work helped establish the Hoyle brand as Sierra's flagship casual gaming series, creating accessible and visually polished games that brought classic card and board games to personal computers.

AbouJaoudé's career demonstrates the evolution of Sierra's business strategy from adventure games toward casual gaming markets. While the Hoyle series lacked the narrative complexity of Sierra's adventure titles, it represented steady commercial success and required sophisticated visual design to make familiar games feel fresh on computer platforms.[^ref-2]

## Career

### Sierra Entertainment

AbouJaoudé joined Sierra Entertainment in the mid-1990s, initially working as an artist on the Hoyle game series.[^ref-1] His first credited work was on Hoyle Classic Games (1995), where he served as Lead Artist, establishing his visual direction for the series.[^ref-3] This early work demonstrated his ability to create polished, appealing graphics that would define the Hoyle brand for over a decade.

Throughout the late 1990s, AbouJaoudé's role expanded from pure art direction into game design. On titles like Hoyle Board Games (1998) and Hoyle Card Games (1999), he contributed to both visual design and game mechanics.[^ref-4] His dual expertise in art and design made him valuable for creating cohesive gaming experiences where visual presentation and gameplay worked together seamlessly.

By the 2000s, AbouJaoudé had risen to prominent leadership positions on the Hoyle series. He served as Art Director on major releases including Hoyle Casino (2001), Hoyle Table Games 2004 (2003), and multiple entries in the Card Games and Board Games lines.[^ref-5] His design credits on titles like Hoyle Kids Games (2000) and Hoyle Poker Series (2005) reflect his involvement in shaping game mechanics and user experience across different Hoyle product lines.[^ref-6]

### Later Work

Following Sierra's corporate transitions, AbouJaoudé continued working on casual games, contributing to titles like the Little Shop hidden object series (2008-2009) and other casual gaming products.[^ref-7] His graphic design work on games like Ancient Secrets: Quest for the Golden Key (2008) and Sunset Studio: Love on the High Seas (2009) demonstrated his adaptability to the rapidly growing casual game market.[^ref-8]

## Notable Works

### Hoyle Puzzle & Board Games (2009)

AbouJaoudé served as both Designer and Art Director on this comprehensive collection of classic games.[^ref-9] The title combined decades of Hoyle series expertise into a single package, featuring polished visuals and refined gameplay across dozens of game variants. His leadership on both the design and art teams ensured consistency between visual presentation and game mechanics.

### Hoyle Poker Series (2005)

On this poker-focused collection, AbouJaoudé contributed as Designer and Lead Artist/3D Illustrator.[^ref-10] The game required creating compelling visual representations of poker environments and animated character opponents while designing engaging gameplay mechanics for various poker variants.

### Hoyle Card Games (1999)

This foundational entry in the modern Hoyle series featured AbouJaoudé's design and artwork contributions.[^ref-4] The game established many conventions that would carry through subsequent Hoyle releases, combining traditional card game rules with accessible computer interfaces.

## Design Philosophy

AbouJaoudé's work on the Hoyle series reflects a philosophy of accessibility and visual polish. Unlike Sierra's adventure games with their complex narratives and challenging puzzles, the Hoyle games required a different approach: making familiar games feel fresh and engaging on computer platforms while remaining immediately accessible to players of all ages and skill levels.[^ref-2]

His dual expertise in art and design allowed him to create cohesive experiences where visual presentation supported gameplay rather than merely decorating it. The character animations in Hoyle Poker, the board representations in Hoyle Board Games, and the interface designs across the series all demonstrate this integration of visual and interactive design.[^ref-11]

## Legacy

Rabih AbouJaoudé's 15-year career at Sierra Entertainment spans an important but often overlooked chapter in the company's history.[^ref-1] While the Hoyle series lacked the prestige of Sierra's adventure game franchises, it represented consistent commercial success and demonstrated the company's ability to compete in the casual gaming market that would eventually dominate the industry.

His transition from adventure game era Sierra to casual gaming reflects broader industry trends, and his ability to adapt his skills across different game types and platforms demonstrates the versatility required for long careers in game development. The visual standards he established for the Hoyle series continued to influence subsequent releases even after Sierra's corporate restructuring.
