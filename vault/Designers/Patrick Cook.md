<small style="color: gray">Last updated: February 12, 2026</small>

## Overview

Patrick Cook (sometimes credited as Pat Cook) is a veteran video game producer, designer, and studio manager whose career spans from the golden age of Cinemaware's interactive movies through Microsoft's major flight simulation and racing franchises.[^ref-1] Beginning as a producer on Cinemaware classics like Rocket Ranger and It Came from the Desert in the late 1980s, Cook transitioned to Sierra's Dynamix division where he became the original designer and director of the Front Page Sports football franchise.[^ref-2]

Cook's career demonstrates remarkable adaptability across gaming genres. From producing action-adventure games at Cinemaware to designing landmark sports simulations at Dynamix, then directing strategy titles like [[1997 - Outpost 2 - Divided Destiny\|Outpost 2: Divided Destiny]], he evolved into senior management roles at Microsoft Game Studios.[^ref-3] His later career saw him serve as Design Manager on Microsoft Flight Simulator X and as part of the leadership at Turn 10 Studios working on the Forza franchise.[^ref-4]

## Career

### Cinemaware Years (1987–1991)

Cook began his video game career at Cinemaware, the Los Angeles-based studio known for its innovative "interactive movie" approach to game design.[^ref-5] At Cinemaware, he worked alongside industry pioneers on titles that pushed the boundaries of narrative and presentation in computer games.

His credits during this period include work as a producer on Rocket Ranger (1988), one of Cinemaware's most acclaimed titles that won Best 16-bit Graphics at the Golden Joystick Awards.[^ref-6] He also produced It Came from the Desert (1989–1990), the company's homage to 1950s science fiction B-movies, and contributed to TV Sports: Football across multiple platforms.[^ref-7] A photograph from circa 1989 shows Cook with colleague David Riordan during this formative period.[^ref-1]

Cook's work at Cinemaware established his production skills and gave him experience managing multiplatform development—Rocket Ranger alone was released on Amiga, DOS, Commodore 64, Atari ST, Apple IIGS, and NES, with Cook directing the NES port.[^ref-8]

### Sierra/Dynamix Years (1992–2000)

After Cinemaware's decline in the early 1990s, Cook joined Dynamix, the Eugene, Oregon-based studio that had become part of Sierra On-Line.[^ref-2] At Dynamix, Cook found his signature achievement: creating the Front Page Sports franchise.

Cook served as Designer and Director on [[1993 - Front Page Sports - Football Pro\|Front Page Sports: Football Pro]] (1993), which established the series' reputation for deep simulation and customization.[^ref-9] He continued as Executive Producer and designer on subsequent entries including [[1994 - Front Page Sports - Football Pro '95\|Front Page Sports: Football Pro '95]] (1994) and [[1995 - Front Page Sports - Football Pro '96\|Front Page Sports: Football Pro '96]] (1995).[^ref-2] His "Original Concept" credits on [[1996 - Front Page Sports - Football Pro '97\|Front Page Sports: Football Pro '97]] and [[1997 - Front Page Sports - Football Pro '98\|Front Page Sports: Football Pro '98]] indicate his foundational role in establishing the series' design direction.[^ref-10]

Beyond sports games, Cook directed [[1997 - Outpost 2 - Divided Destiny\|Outpost 2: Divided Destiny]] (1997), Sierra's real-time strategy game set on a colonized planet.[^ref-11] His versatility during the Dynamix years—spanning sports simulation, strategy, and other genres—prepared him for the diverse projects he would later manage at Microsoft.

Cook also contributed to [[2000 - 3-D Ultra Lionel TrainTown Deluxe\|3-D Ultra Lionel TrainTown Deluxe]] (2000), acknowledged for his work on the original TrainTown.[^ref-2]

### Microsoft Game Studios (2000–2013)

Cook transitioned to Microsoft Game Studios around 2000, where he took on increasingly senior management roles.[^ref-12] His early Microsoft work included leadership positions on Motocross Madness 2 (2000), credited for "Leadership, Love, Tales of Misguided Youth."[^ref-2]

He served as Studio Manager on NBA Inside Drive 2003 and NFL Fever 2003 (both 2002), then as Creative Director on NFL Fever 2004 (2003).[^ref-13] These sports game credits built on his Dynamix experience while demonstrating his ability to manage console development for Microsoft's Xbox platform.

Cook's most significant Microsoft contribution came with the flight simulation franchise. He served as ACES Group Design Manager on Microsoft Flight Simulator X (2006), one of the most comprehensive civilian flight simulators ever produced.[^ref-14] He continued with the franchise as Studio Manager and Design Director on Microsoft Flight (2010), the free-to-play successor.[^ref-15]

### Turn 10 Studios (2012–2013)

Cook's final documented game credits came at Turn 10 Studios, Microsoft's racing game division.[^ref-4] He contributed to Forza Horizon (2012), the open-world spinoff developed in collaboration with Playground Games.[^ref-16] His last credited role was as Web Design Director on Forza Motorsport 5 (2013), the Xbox One launch title.[^ref-17]

## Notable Works

### Front Page Sports: Football Pro (1993)

As Designer and Director of [[1993 - Front Page Sports - Football Pro\|Front Page Sports: Football Pro]], Cook created what would become one of the most respected American football simulation series of the 1990s.[^ref-9] The game's emphasis on statistical depth, customization, and authentic playbook design set it apart from arcade-style competitors. Cook's design established the franchise's DNA, which he would refine across subsequent annual releases.

### Outpost 2: Divided Destiny (1997)

Cook directed [[1997 - Outpost 2 - Divided Destiny\|Outpost 2: Divided Destiny]], which significantly improved upon the original Outpost's troubled reception.[^ref-11] The real-time strategy sequel featured warring factions of human colonists and demonstrated Cook's ability to work outside sports games while still delivering deep simulation gameplay.

### Microsoft Flight Simulator X (2006)

As ACES Group Design Manager on Microsoft Flight Simulator X, Cook helped oversee one of the most ambitious flight simulators ever produced.[^ref-14] The game featured unprecedented detail in its recreation of real-world aircraft and landscapes, setting standards that would influence flight simulation for years to come.

## Legacy

Patrick Cook's 26-year career in video games traces the evolution of the industry from boutique studios like Cinemaware through the consolidation era at Sierra and into the modern age of corporate game development at Microsoft.[^ref-1] His progression from producer to designer to director to studio manager reflects the professionalization of game development during this period.

His work on the Front Page Sports franchise helped establish Sierra/Dynamix as a serious competitor in sports gaming, while his Microsoft tenure contributed to flagship franchises across multiple genres.[^ref-2] With 44 credits across 28 games, Cook worked with many of the industry's key figures, including frequent collaborators L. Allen McPheeters, David Aughenbaugh, and Ian Gilliland.[^ref-1]
