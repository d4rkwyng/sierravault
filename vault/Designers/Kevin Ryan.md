In 1998, Ryan embarked on a new chapter in his career by co-founding Top Meadow with Brian Supple, taking on the roles of both co-founder and lead coder.[^ref-19] This venture represented Ryan's transition from working within larger corporate structures to the emerging independent game development scene. At Top Meadow, Ryan continued to innovate, creating games like Puzzle Poker and Minigolf Mania that showcased his ability to adapt to changing market conditions and player preferences.[^ref-20]

His work on Puzzle Poker demonstrated Ryan's willingness to explore new game concepts, even when existing design precedents were limited. When asked about the challenges of developing such a unique concept, Ryan displayed characteristic confidence: "It wasn't really that hard. I've been doing this for over 20 years now and I've gotten used to doing this stuff."[^ref-21] This experience and expertise allowed him to continue creating compelling games well into the 2000s, with Minigolf Mania earning recognition by coming in second place in GameTunnel's Game of the Year sports award.[^ref-22]
