# Welcome, Fellow Adventure Seeker
<img src="sg-logo-roger-graham-400x400.webp" alt="Sierra Vault" width="200" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;">
Pull up a pixelated barstool and mind the slime on the floor—this vault is the digital equivalent of rummaging through Sir Graham's attics, Roger Wilco's mop bucket, and Gabriel Knight's case files all at once. Leisure Suit Larry left the key under the fern, Cedric the Owl has been told to stay quiet, and we promise the Narrator won't deduct points for reading the welcome mat. If you grew up swapping floppies or arguing about parser verbs, you're in the right place. If you didn't… well, we still have snacks.

From the parser-driven adventures of the 1980s through the multimedia extravaganzas of the 1990s, this archive documents Sierra's complete legacy—flagship series, hidden gems, acquired studios like Dynamix and Impressions, fan remakes, and spiritual successors from Sierra alumni still making games today.

> **516 games** · **57 designers** · **46 years of history (1980–2026)** · **24,000+ research sources** · **15–40 citations per page**

## About This Archive

Every page follows a consistent structure—overview, story, gameplay, development, reception, legacy, and references—so you always know where to look. Each entry is backed by **15–40+ citations** from MobyGames, Wikipedia, fan wikis, magazine scans, interviews, and contemporary reviews.

> [!info] How It's Built
> This archive evolved through several generations of AI tooling, with human editorial review at every stage:
> 
> 1. **Grok** — Initial game page drafts and research gathering
> 2. **ChatGPT** — Expanded content generation and source synthesis
> 3. **ChatGPT Codex** — Batch processing scripts and validation tooling
> 4. **Claude Code** — Quality scoring systems and automated fixes
> 5. **OpenClaw + Claude** — Current system: autonomous content generation, dual-model scoring (Claude + GPT), and continuous quality monitoring with local Ollama models (Llama, Qwen) for validation
> 
> **Human oversight:** Every page reviewed and approved before publishing.
> 
> **Research Tools:** Brave Search API, ScraperAPI, DuckDuckGo, Kagi FastGPT, MobyGames, Wikipedia, fan wikis, magazine archives
> 
> **Publishing:** Obsidian vault → GitHub → [sierravault.net](https://sierravault.net) via Obsidian Publish | Mirror: [quartz.sierravault.net](https://quartz.sierravault.net)
> 
> Every claim is traceable to cited sources. If you spot an error, [let us know](#get-in-touch).

> [!abstract] What's Included
> - **Core Sierra** (1980–1999): The golden age of adventure games
> - **Post-Sierra continuations**: Vivendi and Activision-era sequels
> - **Acquired studios**: Dynamix, Impressions, Papyrus, Relic, Coktel Vision, and more
> - **Partner studios**: Where Sierra funded development or had creative involvement (Valve, Monolith, Massive, Troika)
> - **Fan projects**: VGA remakes, fan sequels, and community-driven games
> - **Alumni successors**: Original games by Sierra veterans
>
> If it has traceable Sierra DNA, it belongs here.

> [!info] Selection Methodology
> This archive focuses on **Sierra as a creative entity**, not merely as a publisher or distributor. Games qualify if Sierra:
> - **Developed the game** directly through Sierra On-Line or internal studios
> - **Owned the studio** that created it (Dynamix, Impressions, Bright Star, etc.)
> - **Funded development** with meaningful creative partnership (Valve's Half-Life, Relic's Homeworld, Monolith's No One Lives Forever)
> - **Continued a franchise** that originated with Sierra
> - Was the **primary brand** on the box (not distribution-only arrangements)
>
> **Not included:** Games where Sierra only handled distribution without creative involvement, or licensed titles developed entirely by external studios with no Sierra DNA. This keeps the focus on what made Sierra special as a game-making company rather than documenting every box that happened to have Sierra's logo.
