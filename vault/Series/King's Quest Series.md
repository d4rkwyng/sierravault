# King's Quest Series

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 12, 2026</small>

## Overview

The King's Quest series stands as one of the most influential franchises in video game history, pioneering the graphic adventure genre and establishing Sierra On-Line as the preeminent adventure game developer of the 1980s and 1990s.[^ref-1] Created by [[Roberta Williams]] in 1984, the series introduced players to the fairy tale kingdom of Daventry and its royal family across eight mainline entries, one VGA remake, and a 2015 episodic reboot.[^ref-2]

The original King's Quest was revolutionary for its time—the first adventure game to feature animated characters moving through a graphical world, developed as a showcase for IBM's PCjr computer.[^ref-3] This technical innovation, combined with Roberta Williams' gift for fairy tale storytelling, created a template that would define adventure gaming for over a decade.
