# Quest for Glory Series

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 30, 2026</small>

## Overview

The Quest for Glory series (originally titled "Hero's Quest" before a trademark dispute with the board game HeroQuest)[^ref-1] represents one of gaming's most successful genre hybrids, seamlessly blending Sierra's adventure game expertise with role-playing game mechanics.[^ref-2] Created by husband-and-wife team [[Corey Cole]] and [[Lori Ann Cole]], the series spans five mainline games and one VGA remake, following a customizable hero across diverse fantasy settings inspired by world mythologies.

What set Quest for Glory apart was its character import system—players could transfer their hero from one game to the next, carrying over stats, inventory, and choices across the entire series.[^ref-3] This created unprecedented narrative continuity and player investment, as decisions made in the first game could have consequences four sequels later.

## The Coles' Vision

[[Corey Cole]] and [[Lori Ann Cole]] designed Quest for Glory to answer a simple question: "What if you could actually become the hero in an adventure game?"[^ref-4] Drawing from their backgrounds in tabletop RPGs and adventure gaming, they created a system where:

- **Character classes** (Fighter, Magic User, Thief, Paladin) offered different solutions
- **Stats improved through use** - cast spells to raise magic, climb to build strength
- **Multiple solutions** existed for most puzzles
- **Choices mattered** across the entire series

## Character System

### Classes
- **Fighter** - Combat-focused, direct approach to problems
- **Magic User** - Spell-based solutions, puzzle-oriented
- **Thief** - Stealth and lockpicking, nocturnal activities
- **Paladin** - Unlockable in QFG2, honor-based warrior

### Stats
Characters develop through use-based progression:
- Strength, Intelligence, Agility, Vitality, Luck
- Weapon Use, Parry, Dodge, Stealth, Lockpicking
- Magic, Communication, Honor (Paladin)

### Character Import
Players could import heroes between games, carrying:
- All stats and skill levels
- Equipment and gold
- Class and special abilities
- Story choices and relationships

## World and Settings

Each Quest for Glory drew from distinct real-world mythologies:

### Spielburg Valley (QFG1)
Germanic/Bavarian folklore with trolls, brigands, and a cursed barony. The archetypal fantasy adventure setting.

### Shapeir and Raseir (QFG2)
Arabian Nights-inspired desert cities with djinn, elemental spirits, and palace intrigue. One of gaming's most atmospheric Middle Eastern settings.

### Tarna and the Savanna (QFG3)
East African-inspired setting with Simbani warriors, Leopardmen, and tribal politics. Addressed themes of war and peace.

### Mordavia (QFG4)
Slavic/Romanian horror setting with vampires, dark magic, and Lovecraftian undertones. The darkest and most atmospheric entry.

### Silmaria (QFG5)
Greek mythology finale with the Rites of Rulership, dragon prophecies, and series-spanning callbacks.

## Critical Reception

| Game | Notable Reception |
|------|-------------------|
| QFG1 | Innovative hybrid praised by RPG and adventure fans |
| QFG2 | Considered series peak, exceptional world-building |
| QFG3 | Shorter, transitional entry, but culturally unique |
| QFG4 | Atmospheric masterpiece despite bugs |
| QFG5 | Controversial 3D shift, but satisfying conclusion |
