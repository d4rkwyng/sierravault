# Space Quest Series

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 27, 2026</small>

## Overview

The Space Quest series is Sierra On-Line's beloved science fiction comedy adventure franchise, created by [[Mark Crowe]] and [[Scott Murphy]]—collectively known as the "Two Guys from Andromeda."[^ref-1] Spanning seven games from 1986 to 1995, the series follows the misadventures of Roger Wilco, a hapless janitor who repeatedly stumbles into saving the galaxy despite his best efforts to avoid responsibility.[^ref-2] [[Josh Mandel]] contributed significantly to the series, co-designing Space Quest VI with Murphy after the Two Guys parted ways.

Distinguished by its satirical humor, pop culture parodies, and willingness to kill players in creative and often hilarious ways, Space Quest carved out a unique niche in the adventure game landscape.[^ref-3] Where King's Quest embraced fairy tale sincerity, Space Quest gleefully mocked science fiction tropes while crafting genuinely engaging adventures.

## The Two Guys from Andromeda

[[Mark Crowe]] and [[Scott Murphy]] created Space Quest while working at Sierra, developing the series' distinctive voice through collaborative writing and design.[^ref-4] Their comedic sensibilities complemented each other—Crowe focused on art and visual gags while Murphy handled programming and wordplay.

The duo maintained creative control through Space Quest III, where they literally inserted themselves into the game as captive programmers Roger must rescue from the evil ScumSoft corporation (a parody of software publishers).[^ref-5] After SQ3, the Two Guys worked separately:

- **Space Quest IV** - Both credited, but developed with tension
- **Space Quest V** - Mark Crowe solo (Murphy busy with other projects)
- **Space Quest VI** - Josh Mandel stepped in to co-design with Murphy

## Themes and Humor

### Parody and Satire
Space Quest ruthlessly parodies science fiction franchises and pop culture:
- **Star Wars** - The Sarien storyline echoes Death Star tropes
- **Star Trek** - SQ5 is an extended Next Generation parody
- **Alien** - Face huggers and xenomorph references throughout
- **2001: A Space Odyssey** - HAL parodies and monolith jokes
- **Terminator** - Time travel mechanics in SQ4

### Self-Referential Humor
The series pioneered meta-humor in games:
- SQ3's rescue of the Two Guys from ScumSoft
- SQ4's time travel to "Space Quest XII: Vohaul's Revenge II"
- Constant fourth-wall breaking narrator commentary
- In-game references to Sierra and other Sierra games

### Death as Comedy
Space Quest is infamous for creative player deaths:
- Eaten by Orat monsters
- Dissolved in acid
- Sucked into space
- Crushed, vaporized, and otherwise eliminated
- Each death accompanied by sarcastic narrator commentary

## Roger Wilco

The series' protagonist is the antithesis of the traditional hero:
- **Profession**: Janitor (Second Class, later promoted)
- **Skills**: Mop operation, hiding in closets, surviving by accident
- **Personality**: Lazy, cowardly, but ultimately good-hearted
- **Nemesis**: Sludge Vohaul, an evil scientist with a personal vendetta

Roger's everyman quality made him relatable—he succeeds not through skill or bravery but through persistence and dumb luck, resonating with players who saw themselves in his reluctant heroism.
