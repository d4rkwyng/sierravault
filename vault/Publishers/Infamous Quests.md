## Overview

Infamous Quests is an independent game development and publishing studio founded in 2012 by Steven Alexander and Shawn Mills, the same team behind [[Publishers/Infamous Adventures\|Infamous Adventures]]. While Infamous Adventures focused on free Sierra remakes, Infamous Quests shifted to developing and publishing original commercial adventure games in the classic Sierra style.

For detailed information about the studio's history, notable games, and key people, see [[Developers/Infamous Quests\|Infamous Quests (Developer)]].

## Publishing History

The studio successfully funded their debut game, *Quest for Infamy*, through Kickstarter in 2012, raising over $62,000 from backers. They self-publish their games through digital distribution platforms including Steam and GOG.
