## Overview

The Walt Disney Company's interactive entertainment division has published video games featuring Disney characters and properties since the early 1980s. Disney licensed their characters to various game developers throughout the golden age of computer gaming.

## Sierra Connection

In the mid-1980s, Sierra On-Line developed and published several educational games featuring Disney characters under license from Disney. These titles were among Sierra's early educational offerings and helped establish the company's presence in the children's software market.
