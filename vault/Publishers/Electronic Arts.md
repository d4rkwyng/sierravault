## Overview

Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) is one of the world's largest video game publishers, founded in 1982 by Trip Hawkins. The company has grown from a small publisher emphasizing game designer recognition to a global entertainment giant responsible for franchises like Madden NFL, FIFA, The Sims, and Battlefield.

## Sierra Connection

Electronic Arts published several games developed by studios that would later become associated with Sierra On-Line:

**Dynamix Games:** Before Dynamix was acquired by Sierra in 1990, EA published several of their early titles including *Arcticfox* (1986), *Skyfox II: The Cygnus Conflict* (1987), *Caveman Ugh-lympics* (1989), and *Project Firestart* (1989).

**Papyrus Design Group:** EA published *Indianapolis 500: The Simulation* (1989), developed by Papyrus Design Group, which was later acquired by Sierra.
