# Infamous Adventures

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 17, 2026</small>

## Overview

Infamous Adventures was a freeware game publisher active from 2004 to 2012, specializing in VGA remakes of classic Sierra On-Line adventure games. Founded by Steven Alexander and Shawn Mills, the studio created high-quality fan remakes of Space Quest II and King's Quest III before transitioning to commercial development under the [[Publishers/Infamous Quests\|Infamous Quests]] label.

For detailed information about the studio's history, notable games, and key people, see [[Developers/Infamous Adventures\|Infamous Adventures (Developer)]].

## Publishing Philosophy

Like [[Publishers/AGD Interactive\|AGD Interactive]], Infamous Adventures operated as a non-commercial operation, distributing their remakes for free through their website. The founders eventually transitioned to commercial game development with Infamous Quests while the Infamous Adventures projects remain available as freeware.
