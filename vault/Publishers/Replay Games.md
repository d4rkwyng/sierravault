# Replay Games

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 17, 2026</small>

## Overview

Replay Games was an American video game development and publishing company founded by Paul Trowe in 2011. The company specialized in reviving classic adventure game franchises through high-definition remakes and new entries, with a focus on Sierra On-Line properties.

## Sierra Connection

Replay Games was explicitly founded to acquire and revive classic Sierra adventure game intellectual property. The company's most notable achievement was partnering with [[Designers/Al Lowe\|Al Lowe]] to create *Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded*, an HD remake of the original 1987 Sierra classic.

The company secured rights to several Sierra properties through negotiations with Codemasters (who had acquired rights from Sierra) and launched successful Kickstarter campaigns to fund their remake projects.
