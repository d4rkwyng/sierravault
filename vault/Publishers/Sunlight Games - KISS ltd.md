## Overview

Sunlight Games is an independent game development and publishing studio that specializes in reviving and continuing classic adventure game franchises. The company operates under KISS ltd and has focused on bringing beloved Sierra properties to modern platforms.

## Sierra Connection

Sunlight Games acquired the rights to the Gold Rush! franchise, originally created by Doug MacNeill and The Software Farm for Sierra On-Line in 1988. The original Gold Rush! was a historical adventure game set during the California Gold Rush of 1849.

Sunlight Games has released both a remaster of the original game and a full sequel, continuing the franchise decades after its Sierra debut.
