## Overview

Himalaya Studios is an independent game development and publishing studio founded in 2004 by Britney Brimhall and Christopher Warren—the same founders behind [[Publishers/AGD Interactive\|AGD Interactive]]. While AGD Interactive focuses on free Sierra remakes, Himalaya Studios develops and publishes original commercial adventure games in the classic Sierra style.

For detailed information about the studio's history, notable games, and key people, see [[Developers/Himalaya Studios\|Himalaya Studios (Developer)]].

## Publishing History

The studio self-publishes their games through digital distribution platforms. Their debut title, *Al Emmo and the Lost Dutchman's Mine*, was released in 2006, followed by the long-awaited *Mage's Initiation: Reign of the Elements* in 2019 after over a decade of development.
