## Overview

Berkeley Systems was an American software company founded in 1987, best known for creating the After Dark screensaver series featuring the iconic "Flying Toasters." Sierra On-Line acquired Berkeley Systems in 1997, integrating their catalog into Sierra's entertainment software lineup.

## Sierra Connection

After Sierra's acquisition in 1997, Berkeley Systems continued operating as a subsidiary. The acquisition brought Berkeley's casual gaming expertise to Sierra's portfolio during a period when the company was diversifying beyond traditional adventure games.
