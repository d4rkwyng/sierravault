## Overview

Transolar Games is an independent game development and publishing company founded by [[Designers/Corey Cole\|Corey Cole]] and [[Designers/Lori Ann Cole\|Lori Ann Cole]], the legendary Sierra designers responsible for the *Quest for Glory* series. The company was established to develop and publish new adventure-RPG games in the spirit of their classic Sierra work.

## Sierra Connection

Transolar Games represents the most direct continuation of Sierra's Quest for Glory legacy. Corey and Lori Ann Cole created all five Quest for Glory games at Sierra On-Line (1989-1998) before founding Transolar to create spiritual successors to their beloved series.

The company successfully Kickstarter-funded *Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption* in 2012, raising over $400,000 to develop a new adventure-RPG combining the best elements of Quest for Glory with modern gameplay.
