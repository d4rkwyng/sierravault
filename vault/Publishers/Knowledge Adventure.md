## Overview

Knowledge Adventure is an American educational software publisher founded in 1991, best known for the JumpStart series of educational games for children. The company was acquired by Vivendi Universal Games (parent of Sierra Entertainment) in 2004, bringing it under the same corporate umbrella as Sierra's properties.

## Sierra Connection

After Vivendi's acquisition, Knowledge Adventure continued development of the Dr. Brain educational game series, which was originally created by Sierra On-Line. The Dr. Brain franchise, designed by the [[Designers/Corey Cole\|Coles]], featured puzzle games that challenged players with logic, science, and problem-solving activities.

Knowledge Adventure released several Dr. Brain titles in the late 1990s and 2000s, continuing the legacy of Sierra's educational gaming division.
