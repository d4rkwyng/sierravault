## Overview

Activision Publishing, Inc. is an American video game publisher based in Santa Monica, California, and one of the largest third-party video game publishers in the world.[^ref-1] Founded on October 1, 1979, by former Atari programmers David Crane, Alan Miller, Bob Whitehead, and Jim Levy, Activision holds the distinction of being the first independent, third-party console video game developer.[^ref-2][^ref-3]

The company has evolved significantly from its origins as a pioneering Atari 2600 developer to become a global gaming powerhouse. In July 2008, Activision merged with Vivendi Games (parent of Blizzard Entertainment) to form Activision Blizzard.[^ref-4] Most recently, Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard for $75.4 billion in October 2023, bringing the company under the Microsoft Gaming umbrella.[^ref-5]

## Sierra Connection

Activision's relationship with Sierra properties spans several decades and contexts:

**Vivendi Games Merger (2008):** When Activision merged with Vivendi Games, they inherited [[Publishers/Sierra On-Line\|Sierra]]'s intellectual property portfolio.[^ref-10] While Sierra's adventure game development had largely ended by this point, Activision gained access to the Sierra brand and catalog.

**King's Quest Reboot (2015):** Activision published the episodic *King's Quest* reimagining developed by The Odd Gentlemen, marking a revival of Sierra's most iconic adventure franchise.[^ref-6]

**Dynamix-Era Publishing:** In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Activision published several games with Dynamix connections, including *Deathtrack* (1989) and collaborated on titles like *Conquests of Camelot* and *Conquests of the Longbow*.

## History

### Founding and Golden Age (1979-1983)

Activision was founded by four disgruntled Atari programmers who sought greater recognition and royalties for their work. The company's early success came from titles like *Pitfall!* (1982), which sold over four million copies, and *Kaboom!* (1981), their first million-seller.[^ref-7]

### Video Game Crash and Recovery (1983-1991)

The video game crash of 1983 hit Activision hard, forcing diversification into home computer games and the acquisition of text adventure pioneer Infocom in 1986.[^ref-8] The company renamed itself Mediagenic in 1988 but fell into severe debt by 1991.

### Bobby Kotick Era (1991-2023)

Bobby Kotick purchased the struggling Mediagenic for approximately $500,000 in 1991 and rebuilt the company, reverting to the Activision name.[^ref-9] Under Kotick's leadership, Activision acquired numerous studios and built major franchises including Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Guitar Hero, and Call of Duty.

### Microsoft Acquisition (2023-Present)

Microsoft completed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard on October 13, 2023, for $75.4 billion—the largest acquisition in video game industry history.[^ref-5]
