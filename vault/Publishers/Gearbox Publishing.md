## Overview

Gearbox Publishing is the publishing arm of Gearbox Entertainment, founded in 2016 as a division of [[Developers/Gearbox Software\|Gearbox Software]]. The publishing division handles third-party titles as well as games developed internally, including the Homeworld franchise which they acquired along with the broader Homeworld IP in 2013.

For information about the Gearbox development studio's work on Sierra properties, see [[Developers/Gearbox Software\|Gearbox Software (Developer)]].

## Sierra Connection

Gearbox inherited the Homeworld franchise through their 2013 acquisition from THQ's bankruptcy auction. The Homeworld series was originally developed by [[Developers/Relic Entertainment\|Relic Entertainment]] and published by Sierra Entertainment in 1999. Gearbox has since published remasters and new entries in the series.
