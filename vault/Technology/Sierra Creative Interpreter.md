# Sierra Creative Interpreter (SCI)

<small style="color: gray">Last updated: January 12, 2026</small>

## Overview

The Sierra Creative Interpreter (SCI) was Sierra On-Line's advanced game engine that powered the company's golden age of adventure gaming from 1988 through 1996. Replacing the aging [[Adventure Game Interpreter|AGI]], SCI brought 256-color VGA graphics, point-and-click interfaces, CD-ROM voice acting, and ultimately full-motion video to Sierra's adventure games.

SCI evolved through multiple major versions, each bringing significant technical improvements. The engine powered virtually every major Sierra adventure franchise during its peak years, including King's Quest, Space Quest, Quest for Glory, Gabriel Knight, and Leisure Suit Larry.

## Version History

| SCI1 | 1990-1991 | 320×200 (256 colors) | Point-and-click, voice acting |
| SCI1.1 | 1992-1993 | 320×200 (256 colors) | Refined interface, CD-ROM standard |
| SCI2/2.1 | 1994-1996 | 640×480 (256 colors) | Smart cursor, FMV support |
| SCI3/SCI32 | 1996 | 640×480 (256 colors) | 32-bit, pre-rendered 3D |

## SCI0 (1988-1989)

The first SCI version doubled AGI's resolution while introducing crucial new features.

| Interface | Enhanced text parser with mouse support |
| Audio | PC Speaker, AdLib, Game Blaster, Roland MT-32 |

### Audio Revolution
SCI0 brought professional-quality music to gaming through Roland MT-32 support. The MT-32 synthesizer was described as "equivalent to 8 synthesizers combined," producing orchestral-quality soundtracks that far surpassed previous computer game audio.

Space Quest III (1989) was one of the first games to support the Sound Blaster sound card, establishing what would become the dominant PC audio standard.

- Sierra shifted focus from adventure games

### Preservation
SCI games are preserved through multiple methods:
- **ScummVM** - Complete SCI support (SCI0 through SCI32)
- **FreeSCI** - Early open-source interpreter
- **DOSBox** - Native DOS emulation

### Ongoing Development
The SCI engine has been thoroughly reverse-engineered, enabling:
- Fan-made patches and bug fixes
- HD graphics modifications
- Translation projects
- Technical documentation (SCI Wiki)

## Playing SCI Games Today

### Recommended Setup
- **ScummVM** - Best option for most SCI games (SCI0-SCI1.1)
