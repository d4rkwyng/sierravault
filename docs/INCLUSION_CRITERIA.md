# Inclusion Criteria

This guide defines what qualifies a game for inclusion in Sierra Vault.

## Core Philosophy

This archive focuses on **Sierra as a creative entity**, not merely as a publisher or distributor. We document games where Sierra played a meaningful role in development, funding, or creative direction—capturing what made Sierra special as a game-making company.

## Qualification Categories

Games qualify if they meet **any** of the following criteria:

### 1. Core Sierra (1980–1999)
Games developed or published directly by Sierra On-Line during its independent era.
- Flagship series: King's Quest, Space Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, Quest for Glory, Police Quest, Gabriel Knight, Laura Bow
- Hidden gems: Freddy Pharkas, Torin's Passage, Lighthouse, Shivers, Phantasmagoria
- Educational titles: Dr. Brain, EcoQuest, Pepper's Adventures in Time

### 2. Series Continuity Beyond 1999
Franchise entries released after Sierra's acquisition, maintaining series continuity.
- Vivendi era: King's Quest VIII, Space Quest Collection
- Activision era: King's Quest (2015), Gabriel Knight 20th Anniversary
- Post-Activision: Any future official series entries

### 5. Fan Continuations
Community-created games continuing Sierra traditions:

- **Fan Sequels**: The Silver Lining, Vohaul Strikes Back, Incinerations
- **Original Adventures**: Quest for Infamy, Order of the Thorne, Al Emmo

### 6. Alumni Projects

### 7. Cancelled Games
Unreleased games that reached significant development:
- Games with substantial documentation, screenshots, or playable builds
- Projects officially announced by Sierra
- Stored in `/Games/Cancelled/` with `CXL - YYYY - Title.md` naming
- Lower reference threshold (5+ instead of 15+)
- Examples: King's Quest IX, Space Quest 7, Leisure Suit Larry 4

## What's NOT Included

### Distribution-Only Deals
Games where Sierra merely handled distribution without creative involvement.

### Licensed Titles by External Studios
Products using Sierra IP but developed entirely by outside studios with no Sierra DNA or oversight.

### Unrelated Games
Products that happen to share names or appear in Sierra-adjacent contexts but have no actual Sierra lineage.

## Sierra Lineage Values

Each game page includes a `sierra_lineage` YAML field indicating its relationship to Sierra:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Core Sierra` | Direct Sierra On-Line development/publication (1980–1999) |
| `Sierra Label (Dynamix)` | Dynamix studio games |
| `Sierra Label (Impressions)` | Impressions Games studio |
| `Sierra Label (Coktel)` | Coktel Vision studio games |
| `Sierra Label (Papyrus)` | Papyrus Design Group games |
| `Sierra Label (Bright Star)` | Bright Star Technology games |
| `Sierra Label (Synergistic)` | Synergistic Software games |
| `Sierra Label (Sierra Attractions)` | Sierra Attractions division |
| `Sierra Label (Discovery)` | Discovery games |
| `Sierra Published` | Third-party developed, Sierra published with involvement |
| `Third-Party Published` | Games Sierra localized/distributed (Silpheed, Zeliard) |
| `Fan Project` | Community VGA remakes and fan games |
| `Alumni Project` | Original games by Sierra alumni (Hero-U, SpaceVenture) |
| `Spiritual Successor` | Games inspired by Sierra traditions |
| `Spinoff` | Derivative products (LSL Casino, etc.) |
| `Post-Sierra` | Franchise entries after Sierra's acquisition |

## Edge Cases

### Pre-Acquisition Studio Games
When Sierra acquired a studio, we include that studio's **complete catalog**—not just games made after acquisition. This preserves the creative lineage and helps users understand how these developers evolved.

### Partner Studios vs. Distribution
The key distinction: Did Sierra **fund development** or have **creative partnership**? If yes, the game qualifies. If Sierra only handled box distribution, it doesn't.

### Alumni Spiritual Successors
Games by former Sierra designers qualify when they clearly continue Sierra's adventure gaming legacy, even without using Sierra IP.
