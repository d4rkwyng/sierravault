# Inclusion Criteria

This guide defines what qualifies a game for inclusion in Sierra Vault.

## Core Philosophy

This archive focuses on **Sierra as a creative entity**, not merely as a publisher or distributor. We document games where Sierra played a meaningful role in development, funding, or creative direction—capturing what made Sierra special as a game-making company.

## Qualification Categories

Games qualify if they meet **any** of the following criteria:

### 1. Core Sierra (1980–1999)
Games developed or published directly by Sierra On-Line during its independent era.
- Flagship series: King's Quest, Space Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, Quest for Glory, Police Quest, Gabriel Knight, Laura Bow
- Hidden gems: Freddy Pharkas, Torin's Passage, Lighthouse, Shivers, Phantasmagoria
- Educational titles: Dr. Brain, EcoQuest, Pepper's Adventures in Time

### 2. Series Continuity Beyond 1999
Franchise entries released after Sierra's acquisition, maintaining series continuity.
- Vivendi era: King's Quest VIII, Space Quest Collection
- Activision era: King's Quest (2015), Gabriel Knight 20th Anniversary
- Post-Activision: Any future official series entries

### 3. Acquired/Internal Studios
**Complete catalogs** from studios Sierra acquired, including pre-acquisition titles:

- **Synergistic Software** (acquired 1996): Conan, War in Middle Earth, Spirit of Excalibur
- **Relic Entertainment** (acquired 2004 as part of THQ deal): Homeworld series

### 4. Funded Partner Studios
Games where Sierra provided funding with meaningful creative partnership:
- **Valve**: Half-Life, Counter-Strike (Sierra funded development)
- **Monolith**: No One Lives Forever, Blood (Sierra published with creative involvement)
- **Relic (pre-acquisition)**: Homeworld (Sierra funded and published)
- **Troika Games**: Arcanum (Sierra alumni, Sierra published)

### 5. Fan Continuations
Community-created games continuing Sierra traditions:
- **VGA Remakes**: AGDI's King's Quest remakes, QFG2 VGA, Space Quest II VGA
- **Fan Sequels**: The Silver Lining, Vohaul Strikes Back, Incinerations
- **Original Adventures**: Quest for Infamy, Order of the Thorne, Al Emmo

### 6. Alumni Projects
Original games created by former Sierra designers:
- **Two Guys from Andromeda**: SpaceVenture
- **Lori & Corey Cole**: Hero-U, Summer Daze
- **Ken & Roberta Williams**: Colossal Cave 3D
- **Jane Jensen**: Gray Matter, Moebius
- **Pierre Gilhodes**: Gobliiins 5, Gobliins 6

## What's NOT Included

### Distribution-Only Deals
Games where Sierra merely handled distribution without creative involvement.

### Licensed Titles by External Studios
Products using Sierra IP but developed entirely by outside studios with no Sierra DNA or oversight.

### Unrelated Games
Products that happen to share names or appear in Sierra-adjacent contexts but have no actual Sierra lineage.

## Sierra Lineage Values

Each game page includes a `sierra_lineage` YAML field indicating its relationship to Sierra:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Core Sierra` | Direct Sierra On-Line development/publication (1980–1999) |
| `Dynamix` | Dynamix studio games (pre- and post-acquisition) |
| `Impressions Games` | Impressions studio games |
| `Coktel Vision` | Coktel Vision studio games |
| `Sierra Published` | Third-party developed, Sierra published with involvement |
| `Sierra Subsidiary` | Games from Sierra-owned studios |
| `Fan Remake` | Community VGA remakes of Sierra classics |
| `Fan Game` | Original fan-created games in Sierra style |
| `Spiritual Successor` | Alumni projects continuing Sierra traditions |
| `Post-Sierra` | Franchise entries after Sierra's acquisition |

## Edge Cases

### Pre-Acquisition Studio Games
When Sierra acquired a studio, we include that studio's **complete catalog**—not just games made after acquisition. This preserves the creative lineage and helps users understand how these developers evolved.

### Partner Studios vs. Distribution
The key distinction: Did Sierra **fund development** or have **creative partnership**? If yes, the game qualifies. If Sierra only handled box distribution, it doesn't.

### Alumni Spiritual Successors
Games by former Sierra designers qualify when they clearly continue Sierra's adventure gaming legacy, even without using Sierra IP.
